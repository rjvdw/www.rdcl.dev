      If the Grandmother’s grandchild was killed by the Demon tonight:
      The Grandmother dies.
---

The Grandmother knows who their grandchild is, but if they are killed by
the Demon, the Grandmother dies too.

- During the first night, the Grandmother learns their Grandchild—a good
  player who is a Townsfolk or Outsider. The Grandchild does not learn
  that they have a Grandmother.
- If the Demon kills the Grandchild, the Grandmother dies too. If the
  Grandchild dies by any other means—such as execution, or another type
  of death at night—the Grandmother does not also die.

## How To Run

When preparing the first night, choose a Grandchild by marking any good
character with the **GRANDCHILD** reminder.

During the first night, wake the Grandmother and show them the character
token marked **GRANDCHILD**, then point at the Grandchild player, then
put the Grandmother to sleep.

If the Demon kills the Grandchild, the Grandmother dies - mark them with
the **DEAD** reminder.
