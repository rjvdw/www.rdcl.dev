  Executed good players might not die.
---

The Pacifist prevents good players from dying by execution.

- When a good player is executed, the Storyteller chooses whether they
  die or live.
- As always, when abilities like this function in obvious ways, the
  group is not told why something has happened, only what has happened.
  The group learns that an execution succeeded, but that the executed
  player did not dieâ€”that is all.
- If a player is executed and remains alive, that still counts as the
  execution for today. No other nominations may happen.

## How To Run

If a good character is executed, declare either that they die or they
remain alive. (Do not say why.) Then, begin the night phase. (_Whether
the player lived or died, this was the one execution for the day._)
