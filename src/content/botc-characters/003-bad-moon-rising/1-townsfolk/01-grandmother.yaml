  The Grandmother knows who their grandchild is, but if they are killed
  by the Demon, the Grandmother dies too.

  - During the first night, the Grandmother learns their Grandchild—a
    good player who is a Townsfolk or Outsider. The Grandchild does not
    learn that they have a Grandmother.
  - If the Demon kills the Grandchild, the Grandmother dies too. If the
    Grandchild dies by any other means—such as execution, or another
    type of death at night—the Grandmother does not also die.
howToRun: |
  When preparing the first night, choose a Grandchild by marking any
  good character with the **GRANDCHILD** reminder.

  During the first night, wake the Grandmother and show them the
  character token marked **GRANDCHILD**, then point at the Grandchild
  player, then put the Grandmother to sleep.

  If the Demon kills the Grandchild, the Grandmother dies - mark them
  with the **DEAD** reminder.
