      If the Gossip’s public statement was true: Choose a player not
      protected from dying tonight. That player dies.
---

The Gossip deliberately speaks lies, in the hope of uncovering the
truth.

- Each day, the Gossip may make a public statement. If this statement is
  true, the Storyteller kills a player that night. If it is false, then
  no players die due to the Gossip.
- Mumbled words, whispers, statements the Storyteller doesn’t know are
  true or false, or statements that someone cannot hear don’t count.
  Like the Slayer’s ability, the Storyteller and every player must be
  able to hear and understand the Gossip and be aware that the Gossip is
  using their ability in order for the Storyteller to judge what happens
  next.
- If the Gossip made a true statement during the day while drunk or
  poisoned, but is sober and healthy when their ability triggers that
  night, the Storyteller still kills a player.

## How To Run

Each day, if the Gossip makes a definite, true public statement, put the
Gossip’s **DEAD** reminder in the center of the left side of the
Grimoire as a reminder to yourself to place it tonight.

Each night except the first, if the Gossip made a definite, true public
statement today, you choose any player. The chosen player **dies**—mark
them with the **DEAD** reminder.
