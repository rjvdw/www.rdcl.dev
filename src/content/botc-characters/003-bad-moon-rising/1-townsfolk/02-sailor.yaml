  Each night, choose an alive player: either you or they are drunk until
  dusk. You can't die.
description: |
  The Sailor is either drunk or getting somebody else drunk. While the
  Sailor is sober, they can't die.

  - Each night, the Sailor chooses a player, who will probably get
    drunk.
  - If they choose themself, they lose their “cannot die” ability until
    they become sober.
  - If the Sailor chooses a dead player accidentally, the Storyteller
    prompts them to choose again.
  - If the Sailor chooses another player, the Storyteller chooses which
    player is drunk. If they choose a Townsfolk, the Storyteller will
    usually make the Townsfolk drunk, but if an Outsider, a Minion, or
    the Demon is chosen, then the Storyteller will usually make the
    Sailor the drunk one.
  - While sober, the Sailor cannot die, even if they have not yet woken
    at night to go drinking.
howToRun: |
  Each night, wake the Sailor. They point at any player. Put the Sailor
  to sleep. Either the Sailor or this chosen player becomes
  **drunk**—mark them with the **DRUNK** reminder.

  If the sober Sailor would die, the Sailor remains alive. If the sober
  Sailor is executed, declare that this player is executed but remains
  alive. (*Do not say why.*)
