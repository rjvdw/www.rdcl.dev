The Gambler can guess who is who... but pays the ultimate price if they
guess wrong.

- Each night except the first, the Gambler chooses a player and guesses
  their character by pointing to its icon on the character sheet. If the
  guess is correct, nothing happens. If the guess is incorrect, the
  Gambler dies.
- The Gambler does not learn from the Storyteller whether their guess is
  correct or incorrect.
- The Gambler may choose any player, dead or alive, even themself.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Gambler. They point at any player,
then point at any character icon on their character sheet. Put the
Gambler to sleep. If the chosen player is a different character from the
chosen character icon, the Gambler **dies**â€”mark them with the **DEAD**
reminder.
