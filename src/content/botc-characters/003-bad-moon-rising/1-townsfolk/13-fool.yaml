  The Fool escapes death... once.

  - The first time the Fool dies for any reason, the Fool remains alive.
    They don’t learn that their ability saved their life.
  - If another character’s ability protects the Fool from death, the
    Fool does not use their ability. Only the time that the Fool would
    actually for realsy bona fide be dead does the Fool’s ability
    trigger.
howToRun: |
  If the Fool would die, they remain alive. (*But they die if they are
  drunk or poisoned.*) If the Fool was executed, declare that the player
  was executed but remains alive. (*Do not say why.*)

  Either way, the Fool loses their ability—mark them with the **NO
  ABILITY** reminder.
