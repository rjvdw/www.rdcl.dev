  If both your alive neighbors are good, they can't die.
---

The Tea Lady protects her neighbours from death... as long as they are
good.

- If both alive neighbours of the Tea Lady are currently good, those
  neighbours cannot die. The Demon cannot kill them, nor the Godfather,
  nor the Gossip. If they are executed, they do not die. The only
  exception is the Assassin, who can kill someone protected from death.
- The Tea Lady’s alive neighbours are the two alive players closest to
  the Tea Lady—one clockwise and one counterclockwise. Skip past any
  dead neighbours.
- However, if either alive neighbours is evil, or both are, then the Tea
  Lady does not protect her alive neighbours . If an evil player dies
  and the Tea Lady is now neighbouring two good players, then neither
  can die.

## How To Run

If both alive neighbours of the Tea Lady are good, mark those
neighbours’ character tokens with the Tea Lady’s **CANNOT DIE**
reminders. If either alive neighbour of the Tea Lady is evil, remove
these reminders. Update these reminders immediately based on this
condition throughout the entire game (_such as if a player’s alignment
changes_).

If a player marked **CANNOT DIE** would die, they remain alive. If a
player marked **CANNOT DIE** is executed, declare that the marked player
is executed but remains alive. (_Do not say why._)
