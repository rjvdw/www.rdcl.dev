The Fool escapes death... once.

- The first time the Fool dies for any reason, the Fool remains alive.
  They don’t learn that their ability saved their life.
- If another character’s ability protects the Fool from death, the Fool
  does not use their ability. Only the time that the Fool would actually
  for realsy bona fide be dead does the Fool’s ability trigger.

## How To Run

If the Fool would die, they remain alive. (_But they die if they are
drunk or poisoned._) If the Fool was executed, declare that the player
was executed but remains alive. (_Do not say why._)

Either way, the Fool loses their ability—mark them with the **NO
ABILITY** reminder.
