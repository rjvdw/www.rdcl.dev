      The previously protected and drunk players lose those markers. The
      Innkeeper points to two players. Those players are protected. One
      is drunk.

The Innkeeper protects people from death at night, but somebody gets
drunk in the process.

- The Innkeeper, like the Monk, makes players safe from being killed by
  the Demon. They are also safe from death caused by Outsiders, Minions,
  Townsfolk, and Travellers.
- The Innkeeper only protects players at night, not the day.
- One of the two players that the Innkeeper chooses becomes drunk for
  tonight and the next day. This player may be good or evil, but will
  almost always be good, depending how your game is going. An Innkeeper
  that chooses themself might become drunk, which means they have no
  ability and may die tonight—and the other player they chose to protect
  isn’t safe either.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Innkeeper. They point at any two
players. Put the Innkeeper to sleep. Mark the two chosen players with
**SAFE** reminders. One of the chosen players becomes **drunk**—mark
them with the **DRUNK** reminder. The players marked **SAFE** cannot die
tonight.

At dawn, remove the **SAFE** reminders.

At dusk, remove the **DRUNK** reminder.
