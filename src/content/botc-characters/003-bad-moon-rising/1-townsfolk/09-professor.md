The Professor can bring someone back from the dead.

- Once per game, the Professor can choose a dead player. If that player
  is a Townsfolk, they are resurrected, becoming alive again.
- If the Professor chooses an Outsider, Minion, or Demon, then nothing
  happens, and the Professor’s ability is gone.
- The resurrected player regains their ability, even a “once per game”
  ability they used already.
- Resurrected Townsfolk may or may not get to act on the night of their
  resurrection, depending on whether they would act before or after the
  Professor. If they had a “first night only” or “you start knowing”
  ability, they immediately wake to use it again, as soon as the
  Professor goes to sleep.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Professor. The Professor either
shakes their head no or points to a dead player. Put the Professor to
sleep.

If the Professor chose a dead Townsfolk, the chosen player becomes
**alive** again—mark them with the Professor’s **ALIVE** reminder and
remove their shroud. (_They wake later tonight if they normally would.
If they wake on the first night only, they wake now to use their
ability._) At dawn, after declaring which players died, declare which
player is alive again. (_Do not say why._) **The Professor loses their
ability**—mark them with the **NO ABILITY** reminder and remove their
night token from the night sheet.
