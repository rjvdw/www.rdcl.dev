description: |
  The Pacifist prevents good players from dying by execution.

  - When a good player is executed, the Storyteller chooses whether they
    die or live.
  - As always, when abilities like this function in obvious ways, the
    group is not told why something has happened, only what has
    happened. The group learns that an execution succeeded, but that the
    executed player did not dieâ€”that is all.
  - If a player is executed and remains alive, that still counts as the
    execution for today. No other nominations may happen.
howToRun: |
  If a good character is executed, declare either that they die or they
  remain alive. (Do not say why.) Then, begin the night phase. (*Whether
  the player lived or died, this was the one execution for the day.*)
