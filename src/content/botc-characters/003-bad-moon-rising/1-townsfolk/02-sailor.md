The Sailor is either drunk or getting somebody else drunk. While the
Sailor is sober, they can't die.

- Each night, the Sailor chooses a player, who will probably get drunk.
- If they choose themself, they lose their “cannot die” ability until
  they become sober.
- If the Sailor chooses a dead player accidentally, the Storyteller
  prompts them to choose again.
- If the Sailor chooses another player, the Storyteller chooses which
  player is drunk. If they choose a Townsfolk, the Storyteller will
  usually make the Townsfolk drunk, but if an Outsider, a Minion, or the
  Demon is chosen, then the Storyteller will usually make the Sailor the
  drunk one.
- While sober, the Sailor cannot die, even if they have not yet woken at
  night to go drinking.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Sailor. They point at any player. Put the Sailor to
sleep. Either the Sailor or this chosen player becomes **drunk**—mark
them with the **DRUNK** reminder.

If the sober Sailor would die, the Sailor remains alive. If the sober
Sailor is executed, declare that this player is executed but remains
alive. (_Do not say why._)
