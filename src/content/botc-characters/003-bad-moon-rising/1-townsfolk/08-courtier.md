The Courtier gets a character drunk, without knowing which player it is.

- Once per game, the Courtier chooses a character to be drunk for three
  nights and three days, starting immediately.
- The Courtier does not learn if they were successful or not, so they
  might choose a character that is not in play.
- The Courtier chooses a character, not a player. The Courtier player
  may need to be reminded of this. Evil players bluffing as the Courtier
  may also need to be reminded.
- If the drunk or poisoned Courtier chooses a character, that character
  is not drunk, even if the Courtier later becomes sober and healthy. If
  the Courtier made a character drunk, but the Courtier becomes drunk or
  poisoned, the player they made drunk becomes sober again. If the
  Courtier becomes sober and healthy again before the three nights and
  three days have ended, that player becomes drunk yet again.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Courtier. They either shake their head no or point
at any character icon on their character sheet. Put the Courtier to
sleep.

If the Courtier chose a character icon and that character is in play,
the player of the chosen character becomes **drunk** for three nights
and three days. Tonight, mark them with the Courtier’s **DRUNK 1**
reminder. The next night, replace the **DRUNK 1** reminder with the
**DRUNK 2** reminder. The next night, replace the **DRUNK 2** reminder
with the **DRUNK 3** reminder. At dusk on the next night, remove the
**DRUNK 3** reminder, and **the Courtier loses their ability**—mark them
with the **NO ABILITY** reminder and remove their night token from the
night sheet.

After the Courtier chooses a character to make drunk, do not wake the
Courtier for the rest of the game.
