The Chambermaid learns who woke up at night.

- Each night, the Chambermaid chooses two players and learns if they
  woke tonight. They must choose alive players, and may not choose
  themself. This does not detect which of those players woke, only how
  many.
- This ability only detects characters who woke in order to use their
  ability. It does not detect characters who woke for any other
  reason—such as if the Storyteller woke a Minion to let them know who
  the Demon is, woke the Demon to give them their starting Demon info,
  woke a player due to the ability of a different character, or woke
  someone accidentally.
- If the character woke on a previous night but not this night, they are
  not detected by the Chambermaid.
- Players that woke tonight due to their ability but are drunk or
  poisoned still count as having woke tonight.
- If the Chambermaid chooses a dead player accidentally, the Storyteller
  prompts them to choose again.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Chambermaid. They point at any two alive players
except themself. Show the Chambermaid fingers (0, 1, or 2) equaling the
number of chosen characters who woke tonight. Put the Chambermaid to
sleep.

Do not wake the Chambermaid if there are not two players alive to be
chosen (_due to the Mastermind, Zombuul, etc._).
