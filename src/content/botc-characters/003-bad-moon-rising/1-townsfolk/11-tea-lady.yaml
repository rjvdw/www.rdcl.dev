game: Bad Moon Rising
tagLine: If both your alive neighbors are good, they can't die.
description: |
  The Tea Lady protects her neighbours from death... as long as they are
  good.

  - If both alive neighbours of the Tea Lady are currently good, those
    neighbours cannot die. The Demon cannot kill them, nor the
    Godfather, nor the Gossip. If they are executed, they do not die.
    The only exception is the Assassin, who can kill someone protected
    from death.
  - The Tea Lady’s alive neighbours are the two alive players closest to
    the Tea Lady—one clockwise and one counterclockwise. Skip past any
    dead neighbours.
  - However, if either alive neighbours is evil, or both are, then the
    Tea Lady does not protect her alive neighbours . If an evil player
    dies and the Tea Lady is now neighbouring two good players, then
    neither can die.
howToRun: |
  If both alive neighbours of the Tea Lady are good, mark those
  neighbours’ character tokens with the Tea Lady’s **CANNOT DIE**
  reminders. If either alive neighbour of the Tea Lady is evil, remove
  these reminders. Update these reminders immediately based on this
  condition throughout the entire game (*such as if a player’s alignment
  changes*).

  If a player marked **CANNOT DIE** would die, they remain alive. If a
  player marked **CANNOT DIE** is executed, declare that the marked
  player is executed but remains alive. (*Do not say why.*)
