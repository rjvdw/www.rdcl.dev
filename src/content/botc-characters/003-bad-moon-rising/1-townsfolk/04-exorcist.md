      The Exorcist points to a player, different from the previous
      night. If that player is the Demon: Wake the Demon. Show the
      Exorcist token. Point to the Exorcist. The Demon does not act
      tonight.

The Exorcist prevents the Demon from waking to attack.

- Each night, the Exorcist chooses a player. If they choose a player who
  is not the Demon, the Demon may still attack. If they choose the
  Demon, the Demon does not wake tonight, so does not choose players to
  attack tonight. The Demon learns that they cannot attack and who the
  Exorcist is.
- Any other Demon abilities still function—such as the Zombuul staying
  alive if killed, the Pukka killing a player they attacked on a
  previous night, or the Shabaloth regurgitating a player.
- The Exorcist may not choose the same player two nights in a row.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Exorcist. They point at any
player. Mark the chosen player’s character token with the **CHOSEN**
reminder. Put the Exorcist to sleep.

If the Exorcist chose the Demon, wake the Demon. Show them the **THIS
CHARACTER SELECTED YOU** info token and the Exorcist token, then point
at the Exorcist player. Put the Demon to sleep. Later tonight, do not
wake the Demon.
