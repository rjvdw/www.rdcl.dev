The Minstrel makes everybody drunk if a Minion dies.

- If a Minion is executed and dies, all players (except the Minstrel)
  become drunk immediately and stay drunk all through the night and all
  the following day. Townsfolk, Outsiders, Minions, and even Demons
  become drunk, but not Travellers. This doesn’t happen if a Minion died
  at night.
- If a dead Minion is executed, the Minstrel ability does not trigger—a
  dead character cannot die again! If a Minion is executed but does not
  die, the Minstrel’s ability does not trigger. If the Minstrel is drunk
  or poisoned when a Minion dies by execution, the Minstrel ability does
  not trigger.

## How To Run

During the day, if a Minion dies by execution, all other players except
Travellers become **drunk**—put the Minstrel’s **EVERYONE IS DRUNK**
reminder in the center of the left side of the Grimoire.

At dusk tomorrow, all players made drunk by the Minstrel become
**sober**—remove the **EVERYONE IS DRUNK** reminder.
