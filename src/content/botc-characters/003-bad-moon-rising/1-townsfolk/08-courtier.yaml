  The Courtier gets a character drunk, without knowing which player it
  is.

  - Once per game, the Courtier chooses a character to be drunk for
    three nights and three days, starting immediately.
  - The Courtier does not learn if they were successful or not, so they
    might choose a character that is not in play.
  - The Courtier chooses a character, not a player. The Courtier player
    may need to be reminded of this. Evil players bluffing as the
    Courtier may also need to be reminded.
  - If the drunk or poisoned Courtier chooses a character, that
    character is not drunk, even if the Courtier later becomes sober and
    healthy. If the Courtier made a character drunk, but the Courtier
    becomes drunk or poisoned, the player they made drunk becomes sober
    again. If the Courtier becomes sober and healthy again before the
    three nights and three days have ended, that player becomes drunk
    yet again.
howToRun: |
  Each night, wake the Courtier. They either shake their head no or
  point at any character icon on their character sheet. Put the Courtier
  to sleep.

  If the Courtier chose a character icon and that character is in play,
  the player of the chosen character becomes **drunk** for three nights
  and three days. Tonight, mark them with the Courtier’s **DRUNK 1**
  reminder. The next night, replace the **DRUNK 1** reminder with the
  **DRUNK 2** reminder. The next night, replace the **DRUNK 2** reminder
  with the **DRUNK 3** reminder. At dusk on the next night, remove the
  **DRUNK 3** reminder, and **the Courtier loses their ability**—mark
  them with the **NO ABILITY** reminder and remove their night token
  from the night sheet.

  After the Courtier chooses a character to make drunk, do not wake the
  Courtier for the rest of the game.
