      If the Moonchild used their ability to target a player today: If
      that player is good, they die.
---

The Moonchild curses someone upon death, killing them too.

- The Moonchild must choose a player within a minute or two of learning
  that they are dead, whether by an execution or at dawn when the
  Storyteller declares who died at night. The Moonchild can take their
  time and get advice from the group before making this decision.
- If the Moonchild chooses a good player, that player dies tonight. If
  they choose an evil player, nothing happens.
- As always, play along if an evil player is bluffing as the Moonchild
  and pretends to use their ability.
- It is not the Storyteller’s responsibility to prompt the Moonchild to
  choose a player. The Moonchild must do this shortly after they learn
  that they are dead. Deliberately not doing so is considered cheating.
- If the Moonchild is sober and healthy at night but was drunk or
  poisoned when they chose a player today, that player dies. If the
  Moonchild is drunk or poisoned at night but was sober and healthy when
  they chose a player today, that player doesn’t die.
- The Moonchild kills the Goon if the Goon was good when the Moonchild
  chose them, regardless of the Goon’s alignment at night.

## How To Run

When you declare that the Moonchild’s player has died, the Moonchild
chooses any alive player. If the chosen player is good, mark their
character token with the **DEAD** reminder. Tonight, the player marked
with the Moonchild’s **DEAD** reminder **dies**.
