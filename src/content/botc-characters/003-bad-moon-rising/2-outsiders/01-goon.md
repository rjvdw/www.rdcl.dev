  Each night, the 1st player to choose you with their ability is drunk
  until dusk. You become their alignment.

The Goon is immune to other characters at night, but keeps changing
allegiances.

- Each night, the first time a player wakes to use their ability and
  chooses the Goon, that player becomes drunk immediately. Their ability
  does not work tonight, nor the next day.
- Later on the same night, if another player wakes to use their ability
  and chooses the Goon, their ability works as normal.
- The Goon cannot make a player drunk unless the player chose the Goon.
  The Storyteller choosing the Goon due to an ability, such as the
  Grandmother’s, doesn’t count.
- As soon as the Goon makes a player drunk, the Goon changes alignment
  to match theirs. The Goon still changes alignment, and makes the
  player drunk, if the player choosing the Goon was already drunk or
  poisoned.
- If chosen by the Assassin, the Goon dies but still turns evil.

## How To Run

At night, if a player chooses to use their ability on the Goon and
nobody is marked with the Goon’s **DRUNK** reminder, this player
immediately becomes **drunk**—mark them with the **DRUNK** reminder.
Finish resolving this player’s ability and put them to sleep. If this
player’s alignment is different from the Goon’s alignment, rotate the
Goon’s character token—right side up for good, upside-down for evil—to
match this player’s alignment, then wake the Goon, give them a thumbs-up
or a thumbs-down (_indicating their new alignment_), then put the Goon
to sleep.

The next dusk, the player that the Goon made drunk becomes
**sober**—remove the Goon’s **DRUNK** reminder.
