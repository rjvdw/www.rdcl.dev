The Lunatic thinks that they are the Demon.

- Much like the Drunk, the Lunatic does not know their real character or
  real alignment. They are woken each night to attack as if they were
  the Demon that is in play, but their choices have no effect because
  they have no Demon ability.
- The Lunatic wakes during the first night to learn three bluffs and the
  appropriate number of Minions, but this information may be wrong.
- The real Demon knows which players the Lunatic chose to attack each
  night.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, put the Lunatic and Demon tokens in the bag.
Once all tokens have been returned to you, swap the positions of the
Lunatic and Demon tokens in the Grimoire.

During the first night, wake the Lunatic and act as if they are the
Demon. Show them the **THESE ARE YOUR MINIONS** info token and point to
a number of players equaling the number of Minions in play. (_These can
be any players, whether or not they are Minions._) Show any three good
character tokens as bluffs. (_These can even be characters that are in
play._)

During the first night, wake the Demon. Show them the **YOU ARE** info
token, then their Demon token. (_This tells them they are the real
Demon._) Show them the **THIS PLAYER IS** info token, then the Lunatic
token, then point at the Lunatic player.

Each night, before the Demon wakes to attack, wake the Lunatic to act as
if they were that Demon. Put a **CHOSEN** reminder on each player they
chose, then put them to sleep. Wake the real Demon, point at the
Lunatic, show the Lunatic token to the real Demon, and point at the
players that the Lunatic chose. Then the Demon acts as normal.
