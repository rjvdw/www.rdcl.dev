    description: The Tinker might die.
---

The Tinker can die at any time, for no reason.

- The Storyteller may kill the Tinker at any time.
- The Tinker cannot die from their ability while protected from death,
  as normal.

## How To Run

At any time, you may decide that the Tinker dies. If this is during the
day, immediately declare that the Tinker has died. If this is during the
night, mark the Tinker with the **DEAD** reminder and wait until dawn to
declare which players died during the night. (_Do not say how._)
