type: Outsider
game: Bad Moon Rising
tagLine:
  Each night, the 1st player to choose you with their ability is drunk
  until dusk. You become their alignment.
description: |
  The Goon is immune to other characters at night, but keeps changing
  allegiances.

  - Each night, the first time a player wakes to use their ability and
    chooses the Goon, that player becomes drunk immediately. Their
    ability does not work tonight, nor the next day.
  - Later on the same night, if another player wakes to use their
    ability and chooses the Goon, their ability works as normal.
  - The Goon cannot make a player drunk unless the player chose the
    Goon. The Storyteller choosing the Goon due to an ability, such as
    the Grandmother’s, doesn’t count.
  - As soon as the Goon makes a player drunk, the Goon changes alignment
    to match theirs. The Goon still changes alignment, and makes the
    player drunk, if the player choosing the Goon was already drunk or
    poisoned.
  - If chosen by the Assassin, the Goon dies but still turns evil.
howToRun: |
  At night, if a player chooses to use their ability on the Goon and
  nobody is marked with the Goon’s **DRUNK** reminder, this player
  immediately becomes **drunk**—mark them with the **DRUNK** reminder.
  Finish resolving this player’s ability and put them to sleep. If this
  player’s alignment is different from the Goon’s alignment, rotate the
  Goon’s character token—right side up for good, upside-down for evil—to
  match this player’s alignment, then wake the Goon, give them a
  thumbs-up or a thumbs-down (*indicating their new alignment*), then
  put the Goon to sleep.

  The next dusk, the player that the Goon made drunk becomes
  **sober**—remove the Goon’s **DRUNK** reminder.
