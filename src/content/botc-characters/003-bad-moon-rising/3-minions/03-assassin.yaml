  The Assassin kills who the Demon cannot.

  - Once per game at night, the Assassin can kill a player. This player
    dies, even if they are protected from death in any way, such as from
    an ability.
  - The Assassin ability is affected by drunkenness and poisoning, as
    normal.
  - If the Assassin attacks the Goon, the Goon dies and turns evil.
howToRun: |
  Each night except the first, wake the Assassin. They either shake
  their head no or point at any player. Put the Assassin to sleep.

  If the Assassin chose a player, that player **dies**— mark them with
  the **DEAD** reminder. This cannot be prevented in any way (*except if
  the Assassin doesn’t have their ability, such as if they’re drunk or
  poisoned*). **The Assassin loses their ability**—mark them with the
  **NO ABILITY** reminder and remove their night token from the night
  sheet. (*The Assassin won’t wake again.*)

      player dies.
