The Devil's Advocate saves players from execution.

- Each night, the Devil’s Advocate chooses a player to protect from
  death by execution. The next day, if that player is executed, the
  execution succeeds but the player remains alive.
- The Devil’s Advocate cannot choose the same player two nights in a
  row, whether or not that player was saved from execution today, and
  they cannot choose a Zombuul that registers as dead.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Devil’s Advocate. They point at any player. Put the
Devil’s Advocate to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the **SURVIVES
EXECUTION** reminder.

If a player marked **SURVIVES EXECUTION** is executed, declare that the
player was executed but remains alive. (_Do not say why._)
