The Assassin kills who the Demon cannot.

- Once per game at night, the Assassin can kill a player. This player
  dies, even if they are protected from death in any way, such as from
  an ability.
- The Assassin ability is affected by drunkenness and poisoning, as
  normal.
- If the Assassin attacks the Goon, the Goon dies and turns evil.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Assassin. They either shake their
head no or point at any player. Put the Assassin to sleep.

If the Assassin chose a player, that player **dies**— mark them with the
**DEAD** reminder. This cannot be prevented in any way (_except if the
Assassin doesn’t have their ability, such as if they’re drunk or
poisoned_). **The Assassin loses their ability**—mark them with the **NO
ABILITY** reminder and remove their night token from the night sheet.
(_The Assassin won’t wake again._)
