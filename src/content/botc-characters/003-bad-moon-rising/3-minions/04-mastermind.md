  If the Demon dies by execution (ending the game), play for 1 more day.
  If a player is then executed, their team loses.
---

The Mastermind can still win after the Demon is dead.

- If the Demon dies by execution, the game continues. The players do not
  learn that the Demon died. The following day, if a good player is
  executed—whether or not they die from it—then evil wins. If an evil
  player is executed or nobody is executed, then the good team wins.
- A dead Demon does not get to attack. They lose their ability, as
  normal. During this extra night and day, other characters’ abilities
  function as normal.
- If the Demon dies and just two players are left alive, the game still
  continues for another day—evil does not win from two players being
  alive, and good did not win by killing the Demon. The Mastermind
  ability says “play for one more day,” and abilities override standard
  game rules.

## How To Run

If the Demon is executed and dies, and the game would end, continue
playing the game. (_Add a shroud as normal. Do not say that the Demon
has died._)

Tomorrow, if a good player is executed, declare that the game ends and
evil wins, but if an evil player or no player is executed, declare that
the game ends and good wins.
