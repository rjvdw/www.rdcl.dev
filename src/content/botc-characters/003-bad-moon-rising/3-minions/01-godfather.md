The Godfather takes revenge when the town kills Outsiders.

- Whenever an Outsider is executed and dies, the Godfather chooses one
  player to die that night.
- The Godfather only kills if an Outsider dies during the day. Outsiders
  that die at night don’t count.
- If the Godfather is in play, this adds or removes one Outsider from
  play.
- At the start of the game, the Godfather learns which Outsiders are in
  play.
- If two Outsiders died today, the Godfather still only kills one player
  tonight.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, before putting the character tokens in the
bag, either remove one Townsfolk and add one Outsider or remove one
Outsider and add one Townsfolk.

During the first night, wake the Godfather. Show them the character
tokens of all Outsiders in play. Put the Godfather to sleep.

If an Outsider dies during the day, mark them with the **DIED TODAY**
reminder. That night, wake the Godfather. They point at any player. Put
the Godfather to sleep. The chosen player **dies**—mark them with the
**DEAD** reminder.
