The Pukka poisons its victims, who die at a later time.

- When the Pukka attacks, their victim is poisoned immediately. The next
  night, just after the Pukka attacks again, that player dies.
- Unlike other Demons, the Pukka acts during the first night.
- The Exorcist prevents the Pukka from waking to poison a player. The
  Innkeeper prevents the Pukka from killing a poisoned player, then that
  player is no longer poisoned.
- If the Pukka is drunk and chooses a player, that player does not
  become poisoned, so does not die the following night.
- If the Pukka was sober when they chose a player the previous night,
  but is drunk at night, that player does not die. But when the Pukka
  sobers up, the poison resumes and kills the player at night.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Pukka. They point at any player. Put the Pukka to
sleep. The chosen player is **poisoned**—mark them with a **POISONED**
reminder.

Each night except the first, the other player marked **POISONED**
**dies**—mark them with a **DEAD** reminder, then remove their
**POISONED** reminder.
