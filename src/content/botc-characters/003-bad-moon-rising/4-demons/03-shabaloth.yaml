name: Shabaloth

type: Demon
game: Bad Moon Rising
tagLine: >-
  Each night*, choose 2 players: they die. A dead player you chose last
  night might be regurgitated.
description: |
  The Shabaloth eats two players per night, but may vomit one of them
  back up the following night.

  - Unlike most Demons, the Shabaloth attacks twice per night. The night
    after the attack, the Storyteller may decide that one of the players
    attacked by the Shabaloth comes back to life.
  - This can be an alive player that was killed, or a dead player that
    was attacked.
  - The regurgitated player regains their ability, even a “once per
    game” ability already used. If they had a “first night only” or
    “start knowing” ability, they may use it again.
howToRun: |
  Each night except the first, wake the Shabaloth. They point at any two
  players, one at a time. Put the Shabaloth to sleep. In the order
  chosen, each chosen player **dies**—mark them with **DEAD** reminders.

  Each later night, just before waking the Shabaloth, you can choose one
  character marked with the Shabaloth’s **DEAD** reminder, and the
  chosen player becomes **alive** again—replace the **DEAD** reminder
  with the Shabaloth’s **ALIVE** reminder, and remove their shroud. They
  wake later tonight if they normally would. If they wake on the first
  night only, they wake now to use their ability. At dawn, after
  declaring which players died, declare which player is alive again.
  (*Do not say why.*)

      One player that the Shabaloth chose the previous night might be
      resurrected. The Shabaloth points to two players. Those players
      die.
