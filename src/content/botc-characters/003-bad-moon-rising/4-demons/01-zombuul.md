      That player dies.

The Zombuul secretly remains alive while in the grave.

- When the Zombuul would die for any reason, they actually don’t die,
  but the Storyteller acts as if they died. The second time the Zombuul
  dies, they die for real and good wins.
- The seemingly dead Zombuul counts as a dead player in almost every
  way. The player’s life token on the Town Square flips to indicate
  their death. The next time they vote, they lose their vote token. They
  cannot nominate, they may vote with the Voudon, they’re not an alive
  neighbor for the Tea Lady, and so on. The only differences are that
  the game continues, the Zombuul still attacks, and the game continues
  if just two other players are alive.
- The Zombuul only wakes at night to attack if nobody died that day. If
  a dead player is executed, the player can’t die again, so the Zombuul
  would still wake.
- If a drunk or poisoned Zombuul dies, good wins. If a “dead” Zombuul
  becomes drunk or poisoned, do not announce that the player is alive.

## How To Run

The first time the Zombuul would die, they remain alive. Declare that
they died, but do not add a shroud to the Zombuul. (_Flip the life token
on the Town Square, as normal._) From now on, the Zombuul registers as
dead.

Each day, if a player dies, mark them with the **DIED TODAY** reminder.
(_If the Zombuul “dies” by execution, they register as dead, so mark the
Zombuul with the DIED TODAY reminder._)

Each night except the first, if any player is marked **DIED TODAY**, do
not wake the Zombuul.

Each night except the first, if no player is marked **DIED TODAY**, wake
the Zombuul. They point at any player. Put the Zombuul to sleep. The
chosen player **dies**—mark them with the **DEAD** reminder.
