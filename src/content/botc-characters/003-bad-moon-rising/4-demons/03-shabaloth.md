      One player that the Shabaloth chose the previous night might be
      resurrected. The Shabaloth points to two players. Those players
      die.

The Shabaloth eats two players per night, but may vomit one of them back
up the following night.

- Unlike most Demons, the Shabaloth attacks twice per night. The night
  after the attack, the Storyteller may decide that one of the players
  attacked by the Shabaloth comes back to life.
- This can be an alive player that was killed, or a dead player that was
  attacked.
- The regurgitated player regains their ability, even a “once per game”
  ability already used. If they had a “first night only” or “start
  knowing” ability, they may use it again.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Shabaloth. They point at any two
players, one at a time. Put the Shabaloth to sleep. In the order chosen,
each chosen player **dies**—mark them with **DEAD** reminders.

Each later night, just before waking the Shabaloth, you can choose one
character marked with the Shabaloth’s **DEAD** reminder, and the chosen
player becomes **alive** again—replace the **DEAD** reminder with the
Shabaloth’s **ALIVE** reminder, and remove their shroud. They wake later
tonight if they normally would. If they wake on the first night only,
they wake now to use their ability. At dawn, after declaring which
players died, declare which player is alive again. (_Do not say why._)
