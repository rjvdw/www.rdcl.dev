tagLine: >-
  Each night, choose a player (not yourself): tomorrow, you may only
  vote if they are voting too.
description: |
  The Butler may only vote when their Master (another player) votes.

  - Each night, the Butler chooses a player to be their Master. This may
    be the same player as last night or a different one.
  - If the Master has their hand raised to vote, or if the Master's vote
    has already been counted, the Butler may raise their hand to vote.
  - If the Master has their hand down, signaling that they are not
    voting, or if the Master lowers their hand before their vote is
    tallied, the Butler must lower their hand too.
  - It is not the Storyteller's responsibility to monitor the Butler.
    They're responsible for their own voting. Deliberately voting when
    they shouldn't is considered cheating.
  - Because exiles are never affected by abilities, the Butler can vote
    freely for an exile.
  - Dead players may only raise their hand to vote if they have a vote
    token. If the Butler chooses a dead player as their Master, this
    still applies.
  - The Butler is never forced to vote.
  - The Butler's vote may be tallied by the Storyteller before or after
    their Master's. Seating position is not important.
howToRun: |
  Each night, wake the Butler. They point at any player. Mark this
  player with the **MASTER** reminder token. Put the Butler to sleep.

  During a nomination, the Butler may only have their hand raised to
  vote if the Master has their hand raised to vote or if the Master's
  vote has already been counted.

  If the Butler accidentally votes illegally, tally the Butler's vote
  anyway. If you don't, the total will be less than it should be, and
  all players will know which player is the Butler, which is unfair for
  the evil team. Mistakes happen. Just play on and have a private chat
  later.
