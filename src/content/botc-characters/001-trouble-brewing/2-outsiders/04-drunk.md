type: Outsider
game: Trouble Brewing
tagLine: >-
  You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk
  character, but you are not.

The Drunk player thinks that they are a Townsfolk, and has no idea that
they are actually the Drunk.

- During setup, the Drunk's token does not go in the bag. Instead, a
  Townsfolk character token goes in the bag, and the player who draws
  that token is secretly the Drunk for the whole game. The Storyteller
  knows. The player does not.
- The Drunk has no ability. Whenever their Townsfolk ability would
  affect the game in some way, it doesn't. However, the Storyteller
  pretends that the player is the Townsfolk they think they are. If that
  character would wake at night, the Drunk wakes to act as if they are
  that Townsfolk. If that Townsfolk would gain information, the
  Storyteller may give them false information instead—and the
  Storyteller is encouraged to do so.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag,
remove the Drunk token and add a Townsfolk character token. Add the
Drunk's **IS THE DRUNK** reminder token to the Grimoire. Put the swapped
Townsfolk character token in the bag, not the Drunk character token.

While preparing the first night, put the Drunk's **IS THE DRUNK**
reminder token by any Townsfolk character token, changing that player's
character to the Drunk. They are now an Outsider, and do not have the
ability of this Townsfolk character. (But they think they do.)

During the game, act as if the Drunk is actually this Townsfolk
character. (If that character would wake to act at night, the Drunk
wakes to act. If their ability would give them information, you can give
false information to them if you wish. See "Drunkenness and Poisoning"
in the rulebook.)
