The Recluse might appear to be an evil character, but is actually good.

- Whenever the Recluse's alignment is detected, the Storyteller chooses
  whether the Recluse registers as good or evil.
- Whenever the Recluse is targeted by an ability that affects specific
  Minions or Demons, the Storyteller chooses whether the Recluse
  registers as that specific Minion or Demon.
- The Recluse may register as either good or evil, or as an Outsider,
  Minion, or Demon, at different parts of the same night. The
  Storyteller chooses whatever is most interesting.
- A Recluse that registers as a particular Minion or Demon does not have
  this character's ability. For example, a Recluse that registers as a
  Poisoner does not wake at night and cannot poison a player.

## How To Run

Each time the Recluse is targeted by an ability that detects or affects
evil characters, choose which character and alignment the Recluse
registers as. (Do whatever is appropriate, such as showing an evil
character token, nodding, giving finger signals, or allowing an ability
to work that would normally only affect evil, Minion, or Demon players.)
