  If you die by execution, your team loses.

The Saint ends the game if they are executed.

- If the Saint dies by execution, the game ends. Good loses and evil
  wins.
- If the Saint dies in any way other than execution—such as the Demon
  killing them—then the game continues.

## How To Run

If the Saint dies by execution, declare that the game ends and evil
wins.

The Saint's ability has the strange phrase "your team loses." In Trouble
Brewing, this will always mean "evil wins" because the Saint is always
good. In other editions, it is possible for characters to change
alignment. If the evil Saint is executed, good wins.
