type: Outsider
game: Trouble Brewing
tagLine: If you die by execution, your team loses.
description: |
  The Saint ends the game if they are executed.

  - If the Saint dies by execution, the game ends. Good loses and evil
    wins.
  - If the Saint dies in any way other than execution—such as the Demon
    killing them—then the game continues.
howToRun: |
  If the Saint dies by execution, declare that the game ends and evil
  wins.

  The Saint's ability has the strange phrase "your team loses." In
  Trouble Brewing, this will always mean "evil wins" because the Saint
  is always good. In other editions, it is possible for characters to
  change alignment. If the evil Saint is executed, good wins.
