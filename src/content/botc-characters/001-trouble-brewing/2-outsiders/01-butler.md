The Butler may only vote when their Master (another player) votes.

- Each night, the Butler chooses a player to be their Master. This may
  be the same player as last night or a different one.
- If the Master has their hand raised to vote, or if the Master's vote
  has already been counted, the Butler may raise their hand to vote.
- If the Master has their hand down, signaling that they are not voting,
  or if the Master lowers their hand before their vote is tallied, the
  Butler must lower their hand too.
- It is not the Storyteller's responsibility to monitor the Butler.
  They're responsible for their own voting. Deliberately voting when
  they shouldn't is considered cheating.
- Because exiles are never affected by abilities, the Butler can vote
  freely for an exile.
- Dead players may only raise their hand to vote if they have a vote
  token. If the Butler chooses a dead player as their Master, this still
  applies.
- The Butler is never forced to vote.
- The Butler's vote may be tallied by the Storyteller before or after
  their Master's. Seating position is not important.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Butler. They point at any player. Mark this player
with the **MASTER** reminder token. Put the Butler to sleep.

During a nomination, the Butler may only have their hand raised to vote
if the Master has their hand raised to vote or if the Master's vote has
already been counted.

If the Butler accidentally votes illegally, tally the Butler's vote
anyway. If you don't, the total will be less than it should be, and all
players will know which player is the Butler, which is unfair for the
evil team. Mistakes happen. Just play on and have a private chat later.
