name: Drunk
source: https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Drunk
type: Outsider
game: Trouble Brewing
tagLine:
  You do not know you are the Drunk. You think you are a Townsfolk
  character, but you are not.
description: |
  The Drunk player thinks that they are a Townsfolk, and has no idea
  that they are actually the Drunk.

  - During setup, the Drunk's token does not go in the bag. Instead, a
    Townsfolk character token goes in the bag, and the player who draws
    that token is secretly the Drunk for the whole game. The Storyteller
    knows. The player does not.
  - The Drunk has no ability. Whenever their Townsfolk ability would
    affect the game in some way, it doesn't. However, the Storyteller
    pretends that the player is the Townsfolk they think they are. If
    that character would wake at night, the Drunk wakes to act as if
    they are that Townsfolk. If that Townsfolk would gain information,
    the Storyteller may give them false information insteadâ€”and the
    Storyteller is encouraged to do so.
howToRun: |
  While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag,
  remove the Drunk token and add a Townsfolk character token. Add the
  Drunk's **IS THE DRUNK** reminder token to the Grimoire. Put the
  swapped Townsfolk character token in the bag, not the Drunk character
  token.

  While preparing the first night, put the Drunk's **IS THE DRUNK**
  reminder token by any Townsfolk character token, changing that
  player's character to the Drunk. They are now an Outsider, and do not
  have the ability of this Townsfolk character. (But they think they
  do.)

  During the game, act as if the Drunk is actually this Townsfolk
  character. (If that character would wake to act at night, the Drunk
  wakes to act. If their ability would give them information, you can
  give false information to them if you wish. See "Drunkenness and
  Poisoning" in the rulebook.)
