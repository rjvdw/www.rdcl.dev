The Undertaker learns which character was executed today.

- The player must have died from execution for the Undertaker to learn
  who they are. Deaths during the day for other reasons, such as the
  Gunslinger choosing a player to kill, or the exile of a Traveller, do
  not count.
- The Undertaker wakes each night except the first, as there have been
  no executions yet.
- If nobody died today, the Undertaker learns nothing. The Storyteller
  either does not wake the Undertaker at night, or wakes them but does
  not show a token.
- If the Drunk is executed, the Undertaker is shown the Drunk character
  token, not the token for the Townsfolk that the Drunk player thought
  they were.

## How To Run

If a player dies by execution, put the Undertaker's **DIED TODAY**
reminder token by the dead player's character token.

Each night except the first, if any player died by execution today, wake
the Undertaker. Show the character token marked **DIED TODAY** to the
Undertaker. Put the Undertaker to sleep. Remove the Undertaker's
reminder token when convenient.

In Trouble Brewing, there can only be one execution per day, and every
execution causes a player to die. In other editions, there may be more
than one execution per day (in which case the Storyteller chooses which
character to show the Undertaker) or the execution does not cause a
death (in which case the Undertaker learns nothing).
