The Librarian learns that a particular Outsider character is in play,
but not exactly which player it is.

- During the first night, the Librarian learns that one of two players
  is a specific Outsider.
- They learn this only once and then learn nothing more.
- The Drunk is an Outsider. If the Librarian learns that one of two
  players is the Drunk, they do not learn the Townsfolk that the Drunk's
  player thinks they are.

## How To Run

While preparing the first night, put the Librarian's **OUTSIDER**
reminder token by any Outsider character token, and put the Librarian's
**WRONG** reminder token by any other character token.

During the first night, wake the Librarian and point to the players
marked **OUTSIDER** and **WRONG**. Show the character token marked
**OUTSIDER** to the Librarian. Put the Librarian to sleep. Remove the
Librarian's reminder tokens when convenient.
