The Investigator learns that a particular Minion character is in play,
but not exactly which player it is.

- During the first night, the Investigator learns that one of two
  players is a specific Minion.
- They learn this only once and then learn nothing more.

## How To Run

While preparing the first night, put the Investigator's **MINION**
reminder token by any Minion character token, and put the Investigator's
**WRONG** reminder token by any other character token.

During the first night, wake the Investigator and point to the players
marked **MINION** and **WRONG**. Show the character token marked
**MINION** to the Investigator. Put the Investigator to sleep. Remove
the Investigator's reminder tokens when convenient.
