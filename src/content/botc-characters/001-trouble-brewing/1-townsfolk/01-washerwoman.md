The Washerwoman learns that a specific Townsfolk is in play, but not who
is playing them.

- During the first night, the Washerwoman is woken, shown two players,
  and learns the character of one of them.
- They learn this only once and then learn nothing more.

## How To Run

While preparing the first night, put the Washerwoman's **TOWNSFOLK**
reminder token by any Townsfolk character token, and put the
Washerwoman's **WRONG** reminder token by any other character token.

During the first night, wake the Washerwoman and point to the players
marked **TOWNSFOLK** and **WRONG**. Show the character token marked
**TOWNSFOLK** to the Washerwoman. Put the Washerwoman to sleep. Remove
the Washerwoman's reminder tokens when convenient.
