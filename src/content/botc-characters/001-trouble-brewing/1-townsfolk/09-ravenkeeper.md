If the Ravenkeeper dies at night, they get to learn one player's
character.

- The Ravenkeeper is woken on the night that they die, and chooses a
  player immediately.
- The Ravenkeeper may choose a dead player if they wish.

## How To Run

If the Ravenkeeper died tonight, wake them. They point at any player.
Show the chosen player's character token to the Ravenkeeper. Put the
Ravenkeeper to sleep.

We advise you to discourage or even ban players from talking about what
they are doing at night as they are doing it.
