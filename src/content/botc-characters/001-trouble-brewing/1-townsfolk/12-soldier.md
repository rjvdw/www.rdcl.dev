The Soldier can not be killed by the Demon.

- The Soldier cannot die from the Demon's ability. So, if the Imp
  attacks the Soldier at night, nothing happens. Nobody dies. The Imp
  does not get to choose another player to attack instead.
- The Soldier can still die by execution, even if the nominator was the
  Demon. The Soldier is protected from the Demon's ability to kill, not
  the actions of the Demon player.

## How To Run

During the night, if the Demon attacks the Soldier, the Soldier remains
alive. (At dawn, declare that no one died at night.)

In other editions, Demons may have abilities other than killing. The
Soldier is also protected from all other harmful effects of the Demon's
ability, such as poisoning or turning the Soldier evil.
