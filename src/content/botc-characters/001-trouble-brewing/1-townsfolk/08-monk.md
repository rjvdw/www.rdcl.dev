The Monk protects other players from the Demon.

- Each night except the first, the Monk may choose to protect any player
  except themself.
- If the Demon attacks a player who has been protected by the Monk, then
  that player does not die. The Demon does not get to attack another
  player—there is simply no death tonight.
- The Monk does not protect against the Demon nominating and executing
  someone.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Monk. The Monk points at any
player except themself. (If the Monk points at themself, shake your head
no and prompt them to point at another player.) Put the Monk to sleep.
Put the Monk's **SAFE** reminder token by the chosen player's character
token.

If the Demon attacks the player marked **SAFE**, the player remains
alive. (Do not mark them with the Demon's **DEAD** reminder token or add
a shroud as you normally would.) At dawn, declare that no one died at
night. (Do not say why.)

At dawn, remove the **SAFE** reminder token.

In other editions, Demons may have abilities other than killing. The
Monk's protection also prevents all other harmful effects of the Demon's
ability, such as poisoning or turning the protected player evil.
