  The Undertaker learns which character was executed today.

  - The player must have died from execution for the Undertaker to learn
    who they are. Deaths during the day for other reasons, such as the
    Gunslinger choosing a player to kill, or the exile of a Traveller,
    do not count.
  - The Undertaker wakes each night except the first, as there have been
    no executions yet.
  - If nobody died today, the Undertaker learns nothing. The Storyteller
    either does not wake the Undertaker at night, or wakes them but does
    not show a token.
  - If the Drunk is executed, the Undertaker is shown the Drunk
    character token, not the token for the Townsfolk that the Drunk
    player thought they were.
howToRun: |
  If a player dies by execution, put the Undertaker's **DIED TODAY**
  reminder token by the dead player's character token.

  Each night except the first, if any player died by execution today,
  wake the Undertaker. Show the character token marked **DIED TODAY** to
  the Undertaker. Put the Undertaker to sleep. Remove the Undertaker's
  reminder token when convenient.

  In Trouble Brewing, there can only be one execution per day, and every
  execution causes a player to die. In other editions, there may be more
  than one execution per day (in which case the Storyteller chooses
  which character to show the Undertaker) or the execution does not
  cause a death (in which case the Undertaker learns nothing).
