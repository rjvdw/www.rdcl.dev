tagLine: >-
  Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are
  the Demon, they die.

The Slayer can kill the Demon by guessing who they are.

- The Slayer can choose to use their ability at any time during the day,
  and must declare to everyone when they're using it. If the Slayer
  chooses the Demon, the Demon dies immediately. Otherwise, nothing
  happens.
- The players do not learn the identity of the dead player. After all,
  it may have been the Recluse!
- A Slayer that uses their ability while poisoned or drunk may not use
  it again.
- The Slayer will want to choose an alive player. Even if the Slayer
  chooses a dead Imp, nothing happens, because a dead player can't die
  again.
- Players may say whatever they want at any time, so a player who's
  pretending to be the Slayer may pretend to use the Slayer ability.

## How To Run

During the day, the Slayer can declare that they wish to use their
ability. If so, the Slayer points at any player. If the chosen player is
an alive Demon, declare that the chosen player dies—put a shroud on
their character token in the Grimoire. If the chosen player is not an
alive Demon, say "Nothing happens." Either way, the Slayer loses their
ability—put the Slayer's **NO ABILITY** reminder token by the Slayer
token.

If a player is bluffing as the Slayer and declares they wish to use
their ability, act as if they were indeed the Slayer—allow time for
discussion, let them make the decision, and act like you're fiddling
with tokens in your Grimoire, then say "Nothing happens."

When the Slayer declares that they wish to use their ability, give the
group a minute or two to discuss who the Slayer should choose. This
allows the group to feel responsible for the win (or the loss!), but the
Slayer always makes the final choice.
