The Chef knows if evil players are sitting next to each other.

- On the first night, the Chef learns exactly how many pairs of evil
  players there are in total. A pair is two players, but one player may
  be a part of two pairs. So, two players sitting next to each other is
  one pair. Three players sitting next to each other is two pairs. Four
  players sitting next to each other is three pairs. And so on.
- The Chef detects evil Travellers just like other character types, but
  only if those Travellers joined the game before the Chef acts.

## How To Run

During the first night, wake the Chef. Show the Chef fingers (0, 1, 2,
etc.) equaling the number of pairs of neighboring evil players. Put the
Chef to sleep.
