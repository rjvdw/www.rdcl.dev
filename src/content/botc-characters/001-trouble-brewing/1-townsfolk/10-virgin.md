game: Trouble Brewing
tagLine: >-
  The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they
  are executed immediately.
---

The Virgin may inadvertently execute their accuser, confirming which
players are Townsfolk in the process.

- If a Townsfolk nominates the Virgin, then that Townsfolk is executed
  immediately. Because there can only be one execution per day, the
  nomination process immediately ends, even if a player was about to
  die.
- Only Townsfolk are executed due to the Virgin's ability. If an
  Outsider, Minion, or Demon nominates the Virgin, nothing happens, and
  voting continues.
- The Virgin's ability is powerful because if a Townsfolk nominates them
  and dies, then both characters are almost certainly Townsfolk.
- After being nominated for the first time, the Virgin loses their
  ability, even if the nominator did not die, and even if the Virgin was
  poisoned or drunk.

## How To Run

If the first player to ever nominate the Virgin is a Townsfolk,
immediately declare that the nominating player is executed. That player
**dies**—put a shroud on their character token in the Grimoire. **The
Virgin loses their ability**—put the Virgin's **NO ABILITY** reminder
token by the Virgin token. End the nomination process and proceed to the
night phase. (No one else can be executed today.)

If the first player to ever nominate the Virgin is not a Townsfolk,
continue the vote as normal. **The Virgin loses their ability**—put the
Virgin's **NO ABILITY** reminder token by the Virgin token.
