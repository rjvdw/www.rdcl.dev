tagLine: >-
  Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are
  the Demon, they die.
description: |
  The Slayer can kill the Demon by guessing who they are.

  - The Slayer can choose to use their ability at any time during the
    day, and must declare to everyone when they're using it. If the
    Slayer chooses the Demon, the Demon dies immediately. Otherwise,
    nothing happens.
  - The players do not learn the identity of the dead player. After all,
    it may have been the Recluse!
  - A Slayer that uses their ability while poisoned or drunk may not use
    it again.
  - The Slayer will want to choose an alive player. Even if the Slayer
    chooses a dead Imp, nothing happens, because a dead player can't die
    again.
  - Players may say whatever they want at any time, so a player who's
    pretending to be the Slayer may pretend to use the Slayer ability.
howToRun: |
  During the day, the Slayer can declare that they wish to use their
  ability. If so, the Slayer points at any player. If the chosen player
  is an alive Demon, declare that the chosen player dies—put a shroud on
  their character token in the Grimoire. If the chosen player is not an
  alive Demon, say "Nothing happens." Either way, the Slayer loses their
  ability—put the Slayer's **NO ABILITY** reminder token by the Slayer
  token.

  If a player is bluffing as the Slayer and declares they wish to use
  their ability, act as if they were indeed the Slayer—allow time for
  discussion, let them make the decision, and act like you're fiddling
  with tokens in your Grimoire, then say "Nothing happens."

  When the Slayer declares that they wish to use their ability, give the
  group a minute or two to discuss who the Slayer should choose. This
  allows the group to feel responsible for the win (or the loss!), but
  the Slayer always makes the final choice.
