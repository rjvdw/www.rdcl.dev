  If only 3 players live & no execution occurs, your team wins. If you
  die at night, another player might die instead.

The Mayor can win by peaceful means on the final day.

- To survive, the Mayor sometimes "accidentally" gets someone else
  killed. If the Mayor is attacked and would die, the Storyteller may
  choose that a different player dies. Nobody learns how they died at
  night, just that they died.
- If there are just three players alive at the end of the day, and no
  execution occurred that day, then the game ends and good wins.
- Travellers count as players for the Mayor's victory, so must be exiled
  first. Remember that exiles are not executions.
- Fabled don't count as players for the Mayor's victory, as the
  Storyteller isn't a player.
- If the Demon attacks the Mayor, and the Storyteller instead chooses a
  dead player, the Soldier, or a player protected by the Monk, that
  player does not die tonight.

## How To Run

During the night, if the Mayor would die, you choose if the Mayor
actually dies, or if the Mayor remains alive and another character
**dies** insteadâ€”put the Demon's **DEAD** reminder token by that
character token instead of the Mayor, and put a shroud on that character
token instead of the Mayor.

At dawn, declare that the player marked **DEAD** died at night. (Do not
say how they died.)

At dusk, if exactly three players are alive and no player was executed
today, declare that the game ends and good wins.
