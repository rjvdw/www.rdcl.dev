  While preparing the first night, put the Investigator's **MINION**
  reminder token by any Minion character token, and put the
  Investigator's **WRONG** reminder token by any other character token.

  During the first night, wake the Investigator and point to the players
  marked **MINION** and **WRONG**. Show the character token marked
  **MINION** to the Investigator. Put the Investigator to sleep. Remove
  the Investigator's reminder tokens when convenient.
