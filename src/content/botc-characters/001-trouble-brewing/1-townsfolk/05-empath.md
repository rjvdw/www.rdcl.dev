The Empath keeps learning if their living neighbours are good or evil.

- The Empath only learns how many of their neighbours are evil, not
  which one is evil.
- The Empath does not detect dead players. So, if the Empath is sitting
  next to a dead player, they do not get info about that dead player.
  Instead, they get info about the closest alive player in that
  direction.
- The Empath acts after the Demon, so if the Demon kills one of the
  Empath's alive neighbours, the Empath does not learn about the
  now-dead player. The Empath's information is accurate at dawn, not at
  dusk.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Empath. Show them fingers (0, 1, or 2) equaling the
number of evil players neighbouring the Empath. Put the Empath to sleep.
