name: Virgin
source: https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Virgin
type: Townsfolk
game: Trouble Brewing
tagLine:
  The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they
  are executed immediately.
description: |
  The Virgin may inadvertently execute their accuser, confirming which
  players are Townsfolk in the process.

  - If a Townsfolk nominates the Virgin, then that Townsfolk is executed
    immediately. Because there can only be one execution per day, the
    nomination process immediately ends, even if a player was about to
    die.
  - Only Townsfolk are executed due to the Virgin's ability. If an
    Outsider, Minion, or Demon nominates the Virgin, nothing happens,
    and voting continues.
  - The Virgin's ability is powerful because if a Townsfolk nominates
    them and dies, then both characters are almost certainly Townsfolk.
  - After being nominated for the first time, the Virgin loses their
    ability, even if the nominator did not die, and even if the Virgin
    was poisoned or drunk.
howToRun: |
  If the first player to ever nominate the Virgin is a Townsfolk,
  immediately declare that the nominating player is executed. That
  player **dies**—put a shroud on their character token in the Grimoire.
  **The Virgin loses their ability**—put the Virgin's **NO ABILITY**
  reminder token by the Virgin token. End the nomination process and
  proceed to the night phase. (No one else can be executed today.)

  If the first player to ever nominate the Virgin is not a Townsfolk,
  continue the vote as normal. **The Virgin loses their ability**—put
  the Virgin's **NO ABILITY** reminder token by the Virgin token.
