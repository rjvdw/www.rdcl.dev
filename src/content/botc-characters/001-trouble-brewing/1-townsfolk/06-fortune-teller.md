The Fortune Teller detects who the Demon is, but sometimes thinks good
players are Demons.

- Each night, the Fortune Teller chooses two players and learns if at
  least one of them is a Demon. They do not learn which of them is a
  Demon, just that one of them is. If neither is the Demon, they learn
  this instead.
- Unfortunately, one player, called the Red Herring, will register as a
  Demon to the Fortune Teller if chosen. The Red Herring is the same
  player throughout the entire game. This player may be any good player,
  even the Fortune Teller themself, and the Fortune Teller does not know
  which player it is.
- The Fortune Teller may choose any two players—alive or dead, or even
  themself. If they choose a dead Demon, then the Fortune Teller still
  receives a nod.

## How To Run

While preparing the first night, put the Fortune Teller's **RED
HERRING** reminder token by any good character token, marking that
player as the Red Herring.

Each night, wake the Fortune Teller. The Fortune Teller points at any
two players. If either chosen player is a Demon or the Red Herring, nod
your head yes. Otherwise, shake your head no. Put the Fortune Teller to
sleep.

In smaller games, making the Fortune Teller their own Red Herring is
sometimes advised, as the Fortune Teller gets more information that way.
