The Baron changes the number of Outsiders present in the game.

- This change happens during setup, and it does not revert if the Baron
  dies. A change in characters during setup, regardless of what happens
  during the game, is shown on character sheets and tokens in square
  brackets at the end of a character's description—like [this].
- The added Outsiders always replace Townsfolk, not other character
  types.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, remove any two Townsfolk character tokens and
add any two Outsider character tokens. (If you add the Drunk, remember
to follow its setup instructions as well.) These Outsider tokens go into
the bag instead of the Townsfolk tokens.
