The Spy might appear to be a good character, but is actually evil. They
also see the Grimoire, so they know the characters (and status) of all
players.

- If any character has an ability that would detect or affect a good
  player, then the Spy might register as good to that character. If any
  character has an ability that detects Townsfolk or Outsiders, then the
  Spy might register as a specific Townsfolk or Outsider to that player.
  It is the Storyteller's choice as to what the Spy registers as, even
  as many characters or both alignments during the same night.
- A Spy that registers as a particular Townsfolk or Outsider does not
  have this character's ability. For example, a Spy that registers as a
  Slayer cannot slay the Demon.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Spy and show them the Grimoire for as long as they
need. Put the Spy to sleep.

Each time the Spy is targeted by an ability that detects or affects good
characters, choose what character and alignment the Spy registers as.
(Do whatever is appropriate, such as showing a good character token,
nodding, giving finger signals, or allowing an ability to work that
would normally only affect good, Townsfolk, or Outsider players.)

Remember to keep your Grimoire tidy and show it to the Spy in the
correct orientation, so the Spy can easily see who is who.
