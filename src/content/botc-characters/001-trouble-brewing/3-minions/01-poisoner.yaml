  Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow
  day.
description: |
  The Poisoner secretly disrupts character abilities.

  - Each night, the Poisoner chooses someone to poison for that night
    and the entire next day.
  - A poisoned player has no ability, but the Storyteller pretends they
    do. They do not affect the game in any real way. However, to keep up
    the illusion that the poisoned player is not poisoned, the
    Storyteller wakes them at the appropriate time and goes through the
    motions as if they were not poisoned. If their ability gives them
    information, the Storyteller may give them false information.
  - If a poisoned player uses a "once per game" ability while poisoned,
    they cannot use their ability again.
howToRun: |
  Each night, wake the Poisoner. They point at any player. The chosen
  player becomes poisoned—put the **POISONED** reminder token by the
  chosen player's character token. Put the Poisoner to sleep. (This
  poisoned player wakes and acts normally. They have no ability, but
  they think they do. If their ability would give them information, you
  can give false information to them if you wish. See “Drunkenness and
  Poisoning” in the rulebook.)

  Each dusk, the poisoned player becomes healthy—remove their
  **POISONED** reminder.
