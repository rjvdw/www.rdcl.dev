  Each night, you see the Grimoire. You might register as good & as a
  Townsfolk or Outsider, even if dead.

  The Spy might appear to be a good character, but is actually evil.
  They also see the Grimoire, so they know the characters (and status)
  of all players.

  - If any character has an ability that would detect or affect a good
    player, then the Spy might register as good to that character. If
    any character has an ability that detects Townsfolk or Outsiders,
    then the Spy might register as a specific Townsfolk or Outsider to
    that player. It is the Storyteller's choice as to what the Spy
    registers as, even as many characters or both alignments during the
    same night.
  - A Spy that registers as a particular Townsfolk or Outsider does not
    have this character's ability. For example, a Spy that registers as
    a Slayer cannot slay the Demon.
howToRun: |
  Each night, wake the Spy and show them the Grimoire for as long as
  they need. Put the Spy to sleep.

  Each time the Spy is targeted by an ability that detects or affects
  good characters, choose what character and alignment the Spy registers
  as. (Do whatever is appropriate, such as showing a good character
  token, nodding, giving finger signals, or allowing an ability to work
  that would normally only affect good, Townsfolk, or Outsider players.)

  Remember to keep your Grimoire tidy and show it to the Spy in the
  correct orientation, so the Spy can easily see who is who.
