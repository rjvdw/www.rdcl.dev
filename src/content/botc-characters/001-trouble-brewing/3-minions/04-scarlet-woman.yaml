  The Scarlet Woman becomes the Demon when the Demon dies.

  - If there are five or more players just before the Demon dies—that
    is, four or more players left alive after the Demon dies—then the
    Scarlet Woman immediately becomes the Demon, and the game continues
    as if nothing happened.
  - Travellers do not count as players when seeing if the Scarlet
    Woman's ability triggers.
  - If less than five players are alive when the Demon is executed, then
    the game ends and good wins.
  - If five or more players are alive when the Imp kills themself at
    night, the Scarlet Woman must become the new Imp.
  - If the Scarlet Woman becomes the Demon, they are that Demon in every
    way. Good wins if they are executed. They attack each night. They
    register as the Demon.
howToRun: |
  If the Demon dies and there were five or more alive players
  immediately before the Demon died, replace the Scarlet Woman token
  with a spare Imp token, changing that player's character from the
  Scarlet Woman into the Imp. (They are now the Demon and have the Imp's
  ability. If they die, good wins.)

  That night, wake the new Imp, show them the **YOU ARE** info token,
  then show them the Imp token.

  In Trouble Brewing, there is only one Demon—the Imp. In other
  editions, there are multiple possible Demons. If the Scarlet Woman
  becomes the Demon, they become the same type of Demon that died, and
  they gain this Demon's ability. When this happens, mark the Scarlet
  Woman with the **IS THE DEMON** reminder and refer to that Demon's
  "How to Run" instructions.
