The Poisoner secretly disrupts character abilities.

- Each night, the Poisoner chooses someone to poison for that night and
  the entire next day.
- A poisoned player has no ability, but the Storyteller pretends they
  do. They do not affect the game in any real way. However, to keep up
  the illusion that the poisoned player is not poisoned, the Storyteller
  wakes them at the appropriate time and goes through the motions as if
  they were not poisoned. If their ability gives them information, the
  Storyteller may give them false information.
- If a poisoned player uses a "once per game" ability while poisoned,
  they cannot use their ability again.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Poisoner. They point at any player. The chosen
player becomes poisoned—put the **POISONED** reminder token by the
chosen player's character token. Put the Poisoner to sleep. (This
poisoned player wakes and acts normally. They have no ability, but they
think they do. If their ability would give them information, you can
give false information to them if you wish. See “Drunkenness and
Poisoning” in the rulebook.)

Each dusk, the poisoned player becomes healthy—remove their **POISONED**
reminder.
