game: Trouble Brewing
tagLine: There are extra Outsiders in play. [+2 Outsiders]
description: |
  The Baron changes the number of Outsiders present in the game.

  - This change happens during setup, and it does not revert if the
    Baron dies. A change in characters during setup, regardless of what
    happens during the game, is shown on character sheets and tokens in
    square brackets at the end of a character's descriptionâ€”like [this].
  - The added Outsiders always replace Townsfolk, not other character
    types.
howToRun: |
  While setting up the game, remove any two Townsfolk character tokens
  and add any two Outsider character tokens. (If you add the Drunk,
  remember to follow its setup instructions as well.) These Outsider
  tokens go into the bag instead of the Townsfolk tokens.
