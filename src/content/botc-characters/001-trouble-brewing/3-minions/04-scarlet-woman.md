The Scarlet Woman becomes the Demon when the Demon dies.

- If there are five or more players just before the Demon dies—that is,
  four or more players left alive after the Demon dies—then the Scarlet
  Woman immediately becomes the Demon, and the game continues as if
  nothing happened.
- Travellers do not count as players when seeing if the Scarlet Woman's
  ability triggers.
- If less than five players are alive when the Demon is executed, then
  the game ends and good wins.
- If five or more players are alive when the Imp kills themself at
  night, the Scarlet Woman must become the new Imp.
- If the Scarlet Woman becomes the Demon, they are that Demon in every
  way. Good wins if they are executed. They attack each night. They
  register as the Demon.

## How To Run

If the Demon dies and there were five or more alive players immediately
before the Demon died, replace the Scarlet Woman token with a spare Imp
token, changing that player's character from the Scarlet Woman into the
Imp. (They are now the Demon and have the Imp's ability. If they die,
good wins.)

That night, wake the new Imp, show them the **YOU ARE** info token, then
show them the Imp token.

In Trouble Brewing, there is only one Demon—the Imp. In other editions,
there are multiple possible Demons. If the Scarlet Woman becomes the
Demon, they become the same type of Demon that died, and they gain this
Demon's ability. When this happens, mark the Scarlet Woman with the **IS
THE DEMON** reminder and refer to that Demon's "How to Run"
instructions.
