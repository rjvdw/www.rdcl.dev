The Imp kills a player each night, and can make copies of itself... for
a terrible price.

- On each night except the first, the Imp chooses a player to kill.
  Because most characters act after the Demon, that player will probably
  not get to use their ability tonight.
- The Imp, because they're a Demon, knows which players are their
  Minions, and knows three not-in-play good characters that they can
  safely bluff as.
- If the Imp dies, the game ends and good wins. However, if the Imp
  kills themself at night, they die and an alive Minion becomes an Imp.
  This new Imp does not act that same night, but is now the Imp in every
  other way—they kill each night, and lose if they die.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Imp. The Imp points at any player.
Put the Imp to sleep. The chosen player **dies**—put the Imp's **DEAD**
reminder by the chosen player's character token in the Grimoire and put
a shroud on it.

If the Imp killed themself at night, choose an alive Minion and replace
their character token with a spare Imp token, changing their character
to the Imp. Wake the new Imp, show them the **YOU ARE** info token, then
show them the Imp token. Put the new Imp to sleep.

At dawn, declare which player died at night. (Do not say how they died.)

If the Imp attacks a dead player at night, let them do so. Whenever a
character's ability says "choose a player," that means that any
player—alive or dead—can be chosen. The Imp may be planning on bluffing
as the Soldier, and this kind of thing helps their bluff look stronger.
