The Poppy Grower prevents the evil players from learning who each other
are.

- The Demon still learns three not-in-play characters that are safe to
  bluff as.
- If the Poppy Grower dies, the Demon and Minions learn who each other
  are, as though it were the first night again.
- If the Poppy Grower becomes drunk or poisoned, Demons and Minions do
  not suddenly learn who each other are. If the Poppy Grower is drunk or
  poisoned when they die, Demons and Minions do not learn who each other
  are, since the Poppy Grower has no ability that night.
- An evil Traveller still learns which player is the Demon when that
  Traveller enters play.

## How To Run

During the first night, wake the Demon. Show the **THESE CHARACTERS ARE
NOT IN PLAY** info token, then any three good character tokens that are
not in play. Then, put the Demon to sleep. Do not do the Minion Info and
Demon Info steps.

If the Poppy Grower dies, mark them with the **EVIL WAKES** reminder.
That night, wake the Minions and let them make eye contact. Show the
**THIS IS THE DEMON** info token, then point to the Demon. Put the
Minions to sleep. Wake the Demon. Show the **THESE ARE YOUR MINIONS**
info token, then point to the Minions. Put the Demon to sleep.
