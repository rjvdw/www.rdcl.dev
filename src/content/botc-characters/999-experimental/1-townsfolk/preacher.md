The Preacher removes the Minion abilities of selected players.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Preacher and have them choose a player. If they
choose a Minion, put a “No Ability” reminder token next to that Minion.
Put the Preacher to sleep. If applicable, wake the Minion the Preacher
chose tonight, show them the “this character selected you” card and the
Preacher token. Put the Minion back to sleep.

From now on, that Minion has no ability. If they would normally wake at
night to make a choice, take an action or learn information due to their
ability, they no longer do so. If their ability would otherwise have an
effect on the game while they are marked by the "No Ability" token, it
does not.

If the Preacher dies, remove all “No Ability” tokens from affected
Minions. The Minions regain their abilities. Minions with expended
once-per-game abilities do not gain another use of that ability.
Affected Minions are not told that the Preacher is dead, but may be able
to figure it out when they start waking up again etc.

If a Preacher is made drunk or poisoned, Minions who have lost their
abilities to the Preacher regain them, but lose them again when the
Preacher becomes healthy and sober.

If a Minion who has been chosen by the Preacher later becomes a
different type of character (ie not a Minion), they are no longer
affected by the Preacher’s ability. Remove the relevant “No Ability”
reminder token. Also, evil players are not affected by the Preacher
ability just because they’re evil, they need to be explicitly a Minion
character in order to be affected.

In a similar vein, a non-Minion who later becomes a Minion is not
affected by having been chosen by the Preacher before they became a
Minion. If the Preacher chooses them after they become a Minion, the
Preacher ability works as normal.

If a preached Minion dies and is resurrected they do not regain their
ability, they are still preached provided the Preacher is still alive.
