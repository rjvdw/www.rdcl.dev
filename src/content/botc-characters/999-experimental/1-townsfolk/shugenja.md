  You start knowing if your closest evil player is clockwise or
  anti-clockwise. If equidistant, this info is arbitrary.

The Shugenja trusts players to their left, or to their right.

- The closest evil player is the player with the smallest number of
  steps from the Shugenja to the evil player.
- If the evil players are ‘equidistant’, that means that the closest
  evil player clockwise is the same number of steps away from the
  Shugenja as the closest evil player anti-clockwise.
- If the evil players are equidistant, the storyteller gives ‘arbitrary’
  information to the Shugenja. This means that the Storyteller chooses
  whether to tell the Shugenja that the closest evil player is clockwise
  or anti-clockwise.
- The Shugenja doesn’t know whether their information is arbitrary or
  not.
- The Shugenja does not learn how many steps away the evil player is.
- If a Shugenja is created mid-game, the Shugenja wakes that night to
  receive their information.
- The Storyteller communicates with the Shugenja by pointing a finger in
  the appropriate direction, but may use other methods if they wish.

## How To Run

During the first night, wake the Shugenja. If the closest evil player is
in a clockwise direction, point your finger horizontally in that
direction. If the closest evil player is in an anti-clockwise direction,
point your finger horizontally in that direction. If the two closest
evil players are equidistant, point your finger horizontally in either
direction. Put the Shugenja to sleep.
