The Fisherman knows something that nobody else can know - what should be
done.

## How To Run

At any time during the day, the Fisherman can approach the Storyteller
privately for some advice to help them win. The Storyteller’s pieces of
advice are not “facts”. They are strategy tips that the Storyteller
believes will help the Fisherman win if they are followed.

Generally, Fisherman advice should be able to be structured as “you
should” or “you should not”. It doesn’t need to explicitly include those
words but should always follow that concept of suggestions that can be
followed, rather than information about what is like a Savant would get.
So “kill player X” or “find out who is the Drunk” or “you should rethink
which info you’re trusting” or “trust player Y” are all great Fisherman
advice, for example.
