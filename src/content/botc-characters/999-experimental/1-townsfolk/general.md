The General knows who is winning.

- If the good team is winning, the Storyteller gives a thumbs up. If the
  evil team is winning, the Storyteller gives a thumbs down. If neither
  team is winning, or the Storyteller isn’t sure, the Storyteller gives
  a thumbs to the side.
- The Storyteller is the judge on which team is winning. Many factors
  may be included, such as how many players of each team are still
  alive, how much information the good team has, how successful the evil
  team’s bluffs seem to be, which players the group wants to execute
  next, or how experienced the Demon player is. All of these, and more,
  will inform the Storyteller’s judgment.
- The Storyteller decides who is winning at the point that the General
  wakes. Previous events in the night may affect their decision.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the General. If you believe that the good team is
winning, give a thumbs up. If you believe that the evil team is winning,
give a thumbs down. If you don’t know which team is winning, give a
thumbs to the side. Put the General to sleep.
