The High Priestess acts on intuition.

- The High Priestess can be shown the same player multiple times in a
  row, or a different player every night.
- The shown player can be alive or dead.
- The shown player can be good or evil.
- There are no official criteria that determine which player the
  Storyteller must show to the High Priestess. It is up to the
  Storyteller’s judgement as to what they think will most benefit the
  High Priestess and the good team in general. It could be because the
  player has important information that has not been revealed yet. Or
  because the player is evil and has a bluff that doesn’t make sense. Or
  because the player is trustworthy and needs to be trusted more. Or
  because the player is good but on the wrong track and needs to be
  corrected. Or something new.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the High Priestess. Point to a player. Put the High
Priestess to sleep.
