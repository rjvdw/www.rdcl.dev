The Amnesiac doesn’t know their own ability.

- The Storyteller decides what the Amnesiac’s ability is. It may be the
  same ability as another character in Blood On The Clocktower,
  something similar, or something original.
- The Amnesiac may wake at any time during the night to learn
  information or to choose a player, or their ability may be passive—not
  requiring action from the Amnesiac player.
- Each day, the Amnesiac talks to the Storyteller in private, and makes
  a guess as to what their ability is. The Storyteller answers “cold” if
  the guess is very wrong, “warm” if the guess is on the right track,
  “hot” if the guess is very close, and “bingo” if the guess is spot on.
- Their guess may be specific, such as “Am I learning two players each
  night that are the same alignment?”, or vague, such as “Is my ability
  something to do with dead players?”

## How To Run

While setting up the game, decide what ability the Amnesiac player has.
During the game, treat that player as if they had that ability, waking
them when needed, prompting them to choose players when needed, or
whatever else is appropriate. Use the Amnesiac’s **?** reminders if you
need to.

Each day, the Amnesiac makes a guess about their ability in private.
Answer “Cold”, “Warm”, “Hot, or “Bingo”.
