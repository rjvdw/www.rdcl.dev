      The Lycanthrope points to a living player: if good, they die and
      no one else can die tonight.

The Lycanthrope roams the night, killing the innocent, whilst the Demon
cowers indoors.

- The Lycanthrope must choose an alive player each night. If the
  Lycanthrope chooses a dead player, the Storyteller shakes their head
  no and prompts the Lycanthrope to choose a different player.
- If the player that the Lycanthrope chooses is good, that player dies,
  and no other players can die tonight.
- If the player the Lycanthrope attacks is evil, that player does not
  die, and other players may die tonight due to other characters’
  abilities, such as the Demon’s.
- If the Lycanthrope attacks a good player but that good player doesn’t
  die, players can still die tonight due to other characters’ abilities.
- Evil characters’ abilities that don’t kill still function normally.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Lycanthrope. They point at any
player. Put the Lycanthrope to sleep.

If the chosen player is good, that player **dies**—mark them with the
Lycanthrope’s **DEAD** reminder. Any other player that would die tonight
remains alive.
