  Each night, choose a player: you learn their alignment. [+0 to +2

The Village Idiots are a group that learn playersâ€™ alignments.

- The Village Idiot that is drunk is chosen by the Storyteller during
  the game setup.
- There may be one, two, or three Village Idiots in play, irrespective
  of the number of players.
- If there is only one Village Idiot in play, they are sober.
- The drunk Village Idiot may get true information.
- When Village Idiots are added to the game during setup, they replace
  other Townsfolk.
- If a Village Idiot is created mid-game, only one is created.
- Village Idiots act one at a time, not all together.
- If all sober Village Idiots exit play, the remaining drunk Village
  Idiot remains drunk.
- If a sober Village Idiot becomes drunk or poisoned by other means, the
  drunk Village Idiot remains drunk.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, before putting the character tokens in the
bag, replace zero, one or two Townsfolk tokens with Village Idiot
tokens. While preparing the first night, mark one Village Idiot with the
**DRUNK** reminder.

During each night, wake any Village Idiot. They point to a player. Give
a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Put that Village Idiot to sleep. Repeat
until all Village Idiots have acted.
