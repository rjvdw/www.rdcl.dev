The Farmer creates more farmers.

- If a Farmer dies at night, another player becomes a Farmer too.
- Only players that are good can become Farmers this way.
- If this new Farmer also dies at night, another Farmer is created.
- Farmers that die during the day, such as by execution, do not create
  more Farmers.
- Farmers that have turned evil, such as from the Mezephelesâ€™ ability,
  can create more Farmers. But Townsfolk and Outsiders that have turned
  evil cannot become a Farmer.
- Farmers do not learn who each other are, but each player that becomes
  a Farmer learns that they are now a Farmer.
- When a player becomes a Farmer, they are no longer their old
  character, and do not have that ability. Any ongoing effects of their
  old ability immediately end.

## How To Run

If the Farmer died tonight, wake an alive good player. Show them the
**YOU ARE** info token and a Farmer character token, then put them to
sleep. Replace their previous character token with a Farmer character
token.
