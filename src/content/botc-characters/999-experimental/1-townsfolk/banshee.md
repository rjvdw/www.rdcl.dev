  If the Demon kills you, all players learn this. From now on, you may
  nominate twice per day and vote twice per nomination.

The Banshee becomes more powerful when dead – nominating and voting
twice as much.

- When alive, the Banshee nominates and votes like a regular player.
- When dead, they may nominate twice per day, even though dead players
  may **normally** not nominate at all.
- When dead, they may vote for any nomination they wish and do not need
  a vote token to do so. They may vote twice for the same nomination.
- The Banshee only gains these powers if they were killed by the Demon.
  Dying by execution or to a non-Demon ability does not count.
- To vote twice, the Banshee player raises both hands when votes are
  counted. If the player is unable to do this due to a physical
  disability, the Storyteller can count their normal vote twice.

## How To Run

If the Banshee is killed by the Demon, place the **HAS ABILITY**
reminder token next to the Banshee and say "The Banshee has awoken" or
something similarly dramatic. The Banshee may nominate twice per day,
but it is the player’s responsibility to remember how many times they
have nominated. The Banshee may raise two hands when voting. When
counting the votes, count each hand as a vote.

If the Banshee is killed by the Demon but does not have their ability at
that time (due to being drunk or poisoned etc.) or is killed by a
non-Demon ability, then do not tell the group that the Banshee ability
has been triggered. The Banshee may not nominate, and needs a vote token
to vote, like a regular dead player.
