The Huntsman saves the Damsel before the Minions find her... hopefully.

- The Damsel can be in play without the Huntsman. During the setup
  phase, if the Huntsman is in play and the Damsel isn’t, the Damsel is
  added. If a Damsel is already in play, the Huntsman doesn’t add a
  second Damsel.
- If the Huntsman correctly chooses the Damsel at night, the Damsel
  becomes a not-in-play Townsfolk immediately. The Storyteller chooses
  which Townsfolk character, and the Damsel learns which one.
- When the Damsel becomes a Townsfolk, they gain that Townsfolk ability
  and lose the Damsel ability.
- The Huntsman gets one guess, and makes it at night.
- The Minions get one guess in total, and make it publicly during the
  day. If a Minion guesses who the Damsel is, evil wins. If a Minion
  incorrectly guesses who the Damsel is, the guess is used, and other
  Minions cannot win by correctly guessing the Damsel.
- If the Damsel is drunk or poisoned but the Huntsman is sober and
  healthy, the Damsel can still become a Townsfolk.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag,
if the Damsel is not already in play, remove a Townsfolk character token
and add the Damsel character token.

Each night, wake the Huntsman.

If they shake their head no, put the Huntsman to sleep.

If they point to a player, put the Huntsman to sleep. **The Huntsman
loses their ability**—mark them with the **NO ABILITY** reminder and
remove their night token from the night sheet. If they chose the Damsel,
wake the Damsel, show the **YOU ARE** info token, then a not-in-play
Townsfolk token, then put the Damsel to sleep. The Damsel now has this
Townsfolk ability, so replace the Damsel character token with this
Townsfolk character token.
