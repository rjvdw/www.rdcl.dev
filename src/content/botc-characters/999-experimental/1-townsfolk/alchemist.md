    description: Show the Alchemist a not-in-play Minion token
---

The Alchemist has a Minion ability.

- The Alchemist’s ability must be that of a not-in-play Minion. It
  cannot duplicate an in-play Minion’s ability.
- The Alchemist learns which ability this is on the first night.
- They are still a good Townsfolk. They win when good wins, and lose
  when good loses. They register as good and as the Alchemist.
- The Alchemist does not wake to learn who the other Minions are or who
  the Demon is, like Minions do.
- If the Alchemist’s Minion ability adds or removes characters during
  setup, this still occurs during setup.

## How To Run

During the first night, wake the Alchemist. Show the **YOU ARE** info
token then the character token of a not-in-play Minion. Put the
Alchemist to sleep. Mark the Alchemist with the **IS THE ALCHEMIST**
reminder. Swap the Alchemist token with this Minion token. Turn the
Minion token upside-down. (_This shows they are still good._)

The Alchemist has this Minion ability. They use it as if they were a
Minion, and wake at night when that Minion would normally wake to use
their ability.
