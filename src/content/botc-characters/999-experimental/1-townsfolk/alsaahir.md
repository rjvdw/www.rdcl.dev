  Once per day, if you publicly guess which players are Minion(s) and
  which are Demon(s), good wins.
---

The Alsaahir guesses the entire evil team.

- The Alsaahir's guesses need to be public, and they need to be during
  the day. They don't have to guess every day.
- Other players may pretend to be the Alsaahir and make a guess. Like
  the Juggler or the Gossip, the Storyteller will briefly pretend that
  player is the Alsaahir.
- If the Alsaahir guesses the Demon player as the Demon, and the Minion
  players as Minions, the game ends immediately. The Alsaahir must guess
  all Demon and Minion players.
- The Alsaahir doesn't need to guess specific minion characters, nor
  demon characters.
- If there is more than one Demon in play, all Demons must be guessed.
- If a player is a Minion and a Demon, such as Legion, the Alsaahir must
  guess this player as a Demon.
- Once a guess is made, the Alsaahir cannot change their mind later that
  day and guess again.
- The Alsaahir needs to guess Minions and Demons, even if they are good,
  but need not guess which Travellers are evil.
- If the evil team has changed during the game, the Alsaahir must guess
  the current evil team, not the starting evil team.

## How To Run

Each day, once only, if the Alsaahir declares that they wish to use
their ability, prompt them to guess which player is the Demon, and which
player(s) are Minions. If incorrect, nothing happens, and the game
continues. If correct, declare that good wins.
