The Knight knows players that are not the Demon.

- On the first night, the Knight learns two players who are not the
  Demon.
- On subsequent nights, they learn nothing more.
- The Knight can learn Townsfolk, Outsiders or even Minions but does not
  learn which character type they are.

## How To Run

During setup, mark two non-Demon players with the Knightâ€™s **KNOW**
reminders. During the first night, wake the Knight. Point to the two
players marked **KNOW**.
