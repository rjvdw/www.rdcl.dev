The Acrobat dies if the people they choose are drunk or poisoned.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Acrobat. The Acrobat points at a
player. Put the Acrobat to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the
**CHOSEN** reminder token.

If the chosen player is drunk or poisoned at any point during the night
phase, the Acrobat diesâ€”put the Acrobat **DEAD** by the Acrobat's
character token in the Grimoire and put a shroud on it.
