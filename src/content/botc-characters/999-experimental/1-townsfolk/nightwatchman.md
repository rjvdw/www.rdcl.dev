The Nightwatchman is known by one player.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Nightwatchman. If they shake their head, put them
back to sleep. If they point at a player, put the Nightwatchman to
sleep, wake the chosen player and show them the “This character selected
you” info token and the Nightwatchman token, then point to the
Nightwatchman player before putting them back to sleep. Mark the
Nightwatchman with the **NO ABILITY** reminder token.

If the Nightwatchman is drunk or poisoned when they choose a player, put
them back to sleep, do not wake the chosen player and mark that they
have used their once per game ability.

If there is a Vortox in play, wake the player the Nightwatchman chose,
then show that player the relevant tokens and point to any player except
the Nightwatchman.
