The Magician confuses the evil players about who is evil and who isn’t.

- On the first night, instead of learning which player is the Demon, the
  Minions are told that both players—the Demon and the Magician—are the
  Demon.
- On the first night, the Demon learns that the Magician player is one
  of its Minions.
- The Magician does not wake to learn anything.
- The Storyteller can point to the Magician and the evil players in any
  order, so that the evil players won’t know which player is the
  Magician.
- If the Poppy Grower dies and the Demon and Minions learn who each
  other are mid-game, the Magician ability has an effect that night,
  just as if it was the first night.

## How To Run

During the first night, wake the Minions. Show them the **THIS IS THE
DEMON** info token, then point to the Demon and the Magician. Put the
Minions to sleep.

During the first night, wake the Demon. Show the **THESE ARE YOUR
MINIONS** info token, then point to all Minions and the Magician. Show
the **THESE CHARACTERS ARE NOT IN PLAY** info token and three character
tokens. Put the Demon to sleep.

Do this instead of the normal Minion Info and Demon Info steps.
