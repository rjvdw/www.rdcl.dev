The Engineer manufactures the threat that the town faces.

- The Engineer can choose which Minion characters are in play, or which
  Demon is in play, but not both.
- When the Engineer creates new in-play characters, the Demon player
  remains the Demon, and the Minion players remain Minions. The number
  of evil players stays the same.
- If the Engineer tries to create an in-play character, that character
  stays as the same player. The Engineer doesn’t learn this, and may not
  use their ability again.
- If creating Minions, the Engineer chooses the same number of Minions
  that should be in play for the number of players (see the Traveller
  sheet or the setup sheet).
- If the Engineer accidentally chooses too many or too few characters,
  the Storyteller changes as many evil players’ characters as is fair
  and feasible.
- Only characters from the current script may be chosen.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Engineer. They either shake their head no or point
at evil characters on the character sheet.

If they shake their head no, nothing happens. Put the Engineer to sleep.

If they point to a Demon or Minions on their character sheet, put them
to sleep. Swap all appropriate character tokens with new character
tokens. Wake each evil player that changed character, show the **YOU
ARE** info token, then their new character token, then put them to
sleep. **The Engineer loses their ability**—mark them with the **NO
ABILITY** reminder and remove their night token from the night sheet.
