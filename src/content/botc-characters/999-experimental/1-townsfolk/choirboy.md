The Choirboy learns who the Demon is when the King is slain.

- The King can be in play without the Choirboy. During the setup phase,
  if the Choirboy is in play and the King isn’t, the King is added. If a
  King is already in play, the Choirboy doesn’t add a second King.
- If the Demon kills the King using their ability, the Choirboy learns
  which player is the Demon. The Demon nominating and executing the King
  doesn’t count. Minions that kill the King, such as the Assassin, don’t
  count either.
- If the Demon attacks the King but doesn’t kill the King, the Choirboy
  doesn’t learn who the Demon is.
- The Choirboy learns which player the Demon is, but does not learn
  which character.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag,
if the King is not already in play, remove a Townsfolk character token
and add the King character token.

Each night except the first, if the Demon kills the King, put the Demon
to sleep then wake the Choirboy. Point to the Demon player then put the
Choirboy to sleep.
