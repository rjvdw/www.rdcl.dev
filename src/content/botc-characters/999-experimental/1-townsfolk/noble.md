The Noble learns that one of three players is evil.

- The Noble learns their information on the first night only.
- If a Noble is created mid-game, the Noble learns their information on
  their first night.
- The Noble learns two good players and one evil player. They may not
  learn one good player and two evil players. They may not learn three
  evil players.

## How To Run

While preparing the first night, mark two good players' character tokens
with Noble **KNOW** reminders. Mark any evil player's character token
with the third **KNOW** reminder.

During the first night, wake the Noble. Point to all three players
marked **KNOW**. Put the Noble to sleep.
