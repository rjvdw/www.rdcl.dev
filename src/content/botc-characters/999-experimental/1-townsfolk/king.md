The King learns which characters are still alive.

- The King only gains this ability after a few nights have passed—once
  the dead players equal or outnumber the living.
- At the start of the game, the Demon learns who the King is. If a King
  is created mid-game, the Demon learns who the King is that night.
- The King may not survive long enough to use their ability. Once the
  number of dead players is equal to or greater than the number of alive
  players, the King learns one alive character each night.
- The King may learn good or evil characters, and may even learn the
  same character more than once.
- There may not be a Choirboy in play. But if there is, and they are
  still alive when the Demon kills the King, the Choirboy learns who the
  Demon is.

## How To Run

During the first night, wake the Demon. Show them the **THIS PLAYER IS**
info token, then the King token, then point at the King player. Put the
Demon to sleep.

When the number of dead players equals or exceeds the number of alive
players, add a night token to the King’s entry on the night sheet. Each
night, if the King has a night token on the night sheet, wake the King.
Show one alive character token. Put the King to sleep.
