  The Storyteller can break the game rules, and if executed, good wins,
  even if you are dead. [No evil characters]
---

The Atheist knows that all players are good and that there is no such
thing as Demons.

- With the Atheist in play, there are no evil players—no Minions and no
  Demons.
- Good wins if the Storyteller is executed. Any living player may
  nominate the Storyteller, and the Storyteller is executed if 50% or
  more of the living players vote.
- If the Atheist is not in play and the Storyteller is executed, evil
  wins.
- Good loses if just two players are alive.
- The Storyteller may break any of the game’s rules. They may kill a
  player who nominated to simulate a Witch curse, kill players at night
  to simulate a Demon attacking, give players false information to
  simulate drunkenness, change characters at night to simulate a
  Pit-Hag, or even have the wrong number of Outsiders in play.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, before giving the bag to the players, remove
all evil character tokens and add Townsfolk or Outsider character tokens
to match the player count.

Break any game rules, as you see fit. Use evil reminder tokens if you
need them.
