The Pixie pretends to be the same character as someone else.

- On the first night, the Pixie learns an in-play Townsfolk. The
  Storyteller chooses which Townsfolk this is. The Pixie does not learn
  which player is this character.
- If the Pixie player pretends that they are this Townsfolk, they gain
  the ability of this Townsfolk when the Townsfolk dies. They could have
  spoken loudly about being the character for one day, or pretended to
  be the character each day this game, or accused the Townsfolk of being
  a liar—the Storyteller is the judge of whether or not the player was
  convincing, by “being mad that they are this character”.
- When the Townsfolk player dies, the Pixie does not learn this, and is
  not told that they have gained a new ability. They may learn this has
  happened if they wake at night and start gaining information, or are
  prompted to choose players.
- If the player the Pixie learns about changes character then dies, the
  Pixie gains the ability of the Townsfolk the Pixie learnt about, not
  the new character.

## How To Run

During the first night, mark a Townsfolk character token with the
Pixie’s **MAD** reminder. Wake the Pixie. Show the Pixie this Townsfolk
character token. Put the Pixie to sleep.

If the Townsfolk marked **MAD** dies, and you feel that the Pixie player
has been sufficiently **mad** that they were this character, replace the
**MAD** reminder with the **HAS ABILITY** reminder. The Pixie now has
this Townsfolk’s ability, and will wake at night when this Townsfolk
would normally wake.
