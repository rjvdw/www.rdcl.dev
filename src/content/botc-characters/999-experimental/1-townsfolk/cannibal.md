  You have the ability of the recently killed executee. If they are
  evil, you are poisoned until a good player dies by execution.

The Cannibal eats executed characters, gaining their ability.

- If a good player dies by execution, the Cannibal gains that player’s
  ability. If an evil player dies by execution, the Cannibal only thinks
  that they gain an ability, since the Cannibal is poisoned. The
  Storyteller may be lying to them.
- Each time a player dies by execution, the Cannibal loses the ability
  of the previous player.
- Executing a dead player won’t grant the Cannibal an ability. Executing
  a living player who doesn’t die won’t grant the Cannibal an ability. A
  player must be executed and die for the Cannibal to gain their
  ability.
- The Cannibal is not told which ability they have gained. They must
  figure that out for themselves.
- If the Cannibal has an “even if dead” ability, such as the Recluse, or
  an ability that implies it works while dead, such as the Ravenkeeper
  or Sweetheart, the Cannibal keeps that ability when they die, but
  loses their Cannibal ability.

## How To Run

If a good player dies by execution, mark them with the **DIED TODAY**
reminder, and remove the Cannibal’s **POISONED** reminder if necessary.
The Cannibal now has this good player’s ability (do not say which), and
will wake at night when this good character would normally wake.

If an evil player dies by execution, mark them with the **DIED TODAY**
reminder and mark the Cannibal with the **POISONED** reminder. The
Cannibal is poisoned. You may wake them when this evil character would
normally wake, and pretend that they have a new ability.
