Use the Ferryman to create a fun and inclusive climax to the game even
if new players have used their vote tokens.

- If you are running a game for newer players who don’t yet grasp the
  strategy of when to use their dead votes, or have used them when they
  forgot they were dead, you can add the Ferryman. This will ensure
  everyone gets a say in the final day’s critical votes.
- All dead players regain their vote tokens on the final day, regardless
  of alignment or when they voted.
- If a dead player still has their vote token, they do not get a second
  one from the Ferryman.
- The final day is the day that the Storyteller thinks is most likely to
  be the last day of the game – the day where, if the Demon is not
  executed, evil will win. This most likely means the day with only 3
  living players remaining.
- If vote tokens are used on the final day, they aren’t returned.

## How To Run

During the game, when you notice that it would be a good idea to add it,
declare that the Ferryman is in play. Add the Ferryman token to the
Grimoire.

At the start of the final day, ask the players to return vote tokens to
any dead players that do not have one in the Town Square.
