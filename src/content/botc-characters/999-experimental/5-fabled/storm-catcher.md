Use the Storm Catcher to focus the game on a particular good character.

- If you want to construct a script based around the actions or
  information of one particular good character, if you want to have this
  character in every game (_or at least have an evil player bluffing as
  this character_), you can use the Storm Catcher. Your chosen character
  will play a big part in the game, will be the focus of a lot of group
  discussion, and will probably live until the final day.
- The Storyteller declares that one character can’t die, unless by
  execution. This character may be in play, or not in play. If it is in
  play, this good player lives as long as the good players want them to,
  since evil players cannot kill them. If it is not in play, all evil
  players learn this, so any evil player can easily bluff as this
  character. (_They don’t have to, but they can._)

## How To Run

At the start of the game, declare that the Storm Catcher is in play. Add
the Storm Catcher token to the Grimoire. Declare which good character is
favoured by the Storm Catcher. If the favoured character is in play,
mark them with the Storm Catcher’s **SAFE** reminder.

During the first night, wake each evil player in turn. If a good
character is marked with the Storm Catcher’s **SAFE** reminder, show the
evil player the **THIS PLAYER IS** info token, the good character token,
point to the good player, then put the evil player to sleep. If no one
is marked with the Storm Catcher’s **SAFE** reminder, show the evil
player the **THESE CHARACTERS ARE NOT IN PLAY** info token and the good
character token, then put the evil player to sleep.

If the character marked with the Storm Catcher’s **SAFE** reminder is
executed, they die. If they would die by other means, they remain alive.
