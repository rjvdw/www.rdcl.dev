tagLine: This script has homebrew characters or rules.

Add the Bootlegger to include homebrew characters or rules.

- The Bootlegger allows Storytellers to use characters they, or others,
  have created that are not official characters or allows them to use
  non-standard rules in the game.
- If there are homebrew characters on the character sheet, or homebrew
  rules in effect, the Storyteller tells all players what they are
  before play begins.
- The Bootlegger allows for multiple characters or rules to be in effect
  at once.
- As long as there is at least one homebrew character on the current
  script, this Fabled will be in play and can only be removed by
  switching to a script that does not contain any homebrew characters.
- The Bootlegger is designed for use in the official app only.
- Bootlegger, despite many claims to the contrary, defeated Homebrewy
  McHomebrewface, “the people’s choice”, in a hotly contested poll to
  decide the Fabled’s name.

## How To Run

At the start of the game, if there are homebrew characters on the
character sheet or you are running homebrew rules, declare that the
Bootlegger is in play and inform the group of all the homebrew
characters and/or rules you are using in this game.
