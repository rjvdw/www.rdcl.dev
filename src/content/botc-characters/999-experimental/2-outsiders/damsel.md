The Damsel absolutely, positively cannot be found out by the evil team.

- If a Minion guesses that you are the Damsel, and does so publicly (so
  that all players know that they are a Minion), evil wins.
- No matter how many Minions are in play, they only get one guess,
  total. If a Minion makes a guess and is wrong, future guesses by this
  Minion or by other Minions don’t count.
- If the Demon pretends to be a Minion making a guess, that doesn’t
  count as a guess. Minions may still make a guess and win.
- Minions may make a guess at any time.
- If the Damsel dies, they are no longer at risk of being guessed by a
  Minion, since the Damsel loses their ability when dead.
- There may not be a Huntsman in play. But if there is, and the Huntsman
  chooses the Damsel at night, the Damsel becomes a not-in-play
  Townsfolk, and is no longer the Damsel. The Damsel learns which
  Townsfolk and has that Townsfolk ability from then on.

## How To Run

During the first night, wake each Minion. Show the Damsel token. Put
each Minion to sleep.

At any time during the game, if a Minion publicly guesses which player
is the Damsel and is incorrect, mark the Damsel with the **GUESS USED**
reminder. Future guesses by Minion players have no effect.

At any time during the game, if a Minion publicly guesses which player
is the Damsel and is correct, the game ends. Declare that the evil team
wins.
