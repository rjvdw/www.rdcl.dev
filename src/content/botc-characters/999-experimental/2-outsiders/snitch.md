The Snitch accidentally gives information to the evil team.

- The Minions learn three not-in-play characters at the start of the
  game, just like the Demon does.
- These characters may be the same three that the Demon learns, or
  different characters.
- Each Minion may learn different characters to each other. Or they may
  all learn the same three characters.

## How To Run

During the first night, wake a Minion. Show the **THESE CHARACTERS ARE
NOT IN PLAY** info token, then show three not-in-play character tokens.
Put the Minion to sleep. Repeat this process until all Minions have
learnt three not-in-play characters.
