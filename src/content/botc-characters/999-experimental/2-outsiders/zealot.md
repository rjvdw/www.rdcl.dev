The Zealot votes.

- If there are 5 or more players alive, the Zealot must vote for every
  nomination. If there are 4 or fewer players alive, the Zealot can
  choose whether they vote or not.
- Travellers count as alive players.
- The Zealot can vote like a normal dead player when dead.
- The Zealot does not need to vote for exiles.
- A Zealot must vote even if they think they might be drunk or poisoned.
- It is not the Storyteller's responsibility to monitor the Zealot.
  They're responsible for their own voting. Deliberately not voting when
  they should is considered cheating.

## How To Run

During each nomination, if there are 5 or more players alive, the Zealot
must raise their hand to vote.
