  On your 1st night, choose a player (not yourself): you become their
  alignment (you don't know which) even if drunk or poisoned.

The Ogre is someone's best friend.

- The Ogre's chosen player does not change, even if the Ogre is drunk or
  poisoned when they chose.
- The Ogre becomes the same alignment as their chosen player immediately
  on the first night, even if the Ogre is drunk or poisoned.
- The Ogre is not told their alignment at the beginning of the game.
- If the Ogre changes alignment by other means, the Ogre learns their
  new alignment, as normal.
- If an Ogre is created mid-game, the Ogre chooses a player that night,
  and becomes their alignment.

## How To Run

During the first night, wake the Ogre. The Ogre points to a player. Put
the Ogre to sleep. If the Ogre pointed to an evil player, flip the
Ogre's character token upside down to represent that the Ogre is evil.
