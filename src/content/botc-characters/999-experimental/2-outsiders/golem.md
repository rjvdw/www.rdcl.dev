type: Outsider
tagLine:
  You may only nominate once per game. When you do, if the nominee is
  not the Demon, they die.
---

The Golem kills the player they nominate.

- When the Golem nominates a player, that player immediately dies. The
  nomination process continues.
- If the Golem nominates the Demon, nothing happens. The Storyteller
  doesn’t confirm or deny that the Golem nominated, and continues with
  the voting process as normal. The Storyteller may say “nothing
  happens” if clarity is asked for.
- After the Golem has nominated once, whether or not the nominee dies,
  the Golem may not nominate again this game. It is the player’s
  responsibility to refrain from nominating, not the Storyteller’s.
  Deliberately nominating when they shouldn’t is considered cheating.

## How To Run

If the Golem nominates a non-Demon, that player **dies**, then the vote
continues as normal. Mark the Golem with the **MAY NOT NOMINATE**
reminder.

If the Golem nominates the Demon, the vote continues as normal. (**Do
not say why.**) Mark the Golem with the **MAY NOT NOMINATE** reminder.
