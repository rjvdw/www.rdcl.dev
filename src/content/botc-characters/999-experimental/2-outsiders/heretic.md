The Heretic turns a win into a loss, and a loss into a win.

- If the game ends due to the good team winning, then all good players
  lose, and all evil players win.
- If the game ends due to the evil team winning, then all evil players
  lose, and all good players win.
- The Heretic’s ability applies to all victory conditions, including the
  game ending due to just two players being alive, the Demon dying, or
  an ability ending the game.
- The Heretic’s ability functions even when the Heretic is dead, but not
  when the Heretic is drunk or poisoned.

## How To Run

If the game ends and the evil team would have won, declare that the good
team wins and the evil team loses.

If the game ends and the good team would have won, declare that the evil
team wins and the good team loses.
