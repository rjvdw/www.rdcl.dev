The Hatter allows the evil players to change characters.

- Each player with a Minion or Demon character may choose to become any
  character of the same type as their current character.
- They may choose not to change characters.
- If a player becomes a new character, they gain the new ability, even
  if it was a "you start knowing" ability or a once per game ability
  that had already been used.
- Once a player has changed character, their previous character ability
  has no further effect on the game.
- If a player dies then becomes the Hatter, the evil players do not
  change characters tonight.
- Once a character has been chosen, a second player cannot choose the
  same character. If it is already in play, the player with that
  character must choose a new character.

## How To Run

If the Hatter dies, mark them with the **TEA PARTY TONIGHT** reminder.
During that night, wake the Minions and Demon. Show them the **THIS
CHARACTER SELECTED YOU** info token, then the Hatter token. Each player
either shakes their head no or points to another character of the same
type as their current character. If a second player would end up with
the same character as another player, shake your head no and gesture for
them to choose again. Put them to sleep. Remove the **TEA PARTY
TONIGHT** reminder. Change each player to the character they chose.
