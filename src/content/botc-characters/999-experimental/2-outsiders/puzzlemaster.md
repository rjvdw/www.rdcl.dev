The Puzzlemaster tries to figure out who is drunk.

- A player is drunk for the whole game. It will most often be a
  Townsfolk, but could be an Outsider. This player does not know that
  they are drunk.
- Once per game, the Puzzlemaster may guess which player it is. They may
  guess publicly, or privately. Whatever their guess, the Storyteller
  privately tells the Puzzlemaster the name of one player. If the
  Puzzlemaster guessed correctly, they learn which player the Demon is.
  If the Puzzlemaster guessed incorrectly, they learn a different player
  instead.
- The Puzzlemaster isn’t told if they guessed correctly or not.
- Only the player made drunk by the Puzzlemaster counts as a successful
  guess. Players drunk by other means don’t count.
- If the Puzzlemaster dies, the drunk player is still drunk. A dead
  Puzzlemaster may not make a guess, as they don’t have that part of
  their ability.

## How To Run

While preparing the first night, mark any player with the Puzzlemaster’s
**DRUNK** reminder. This player is **drunk**.

At any time during the game, the Puzzlemaster may guess a player, either
publicly or by having a private discussion with you. If their guessed
player is marked by the Puzzlemaster’s **DRUNK** reminder, privately
tell the Puzzlemaster which player is the Demon. If their guessed player
is not marked by the Puzzlemaster’s **DRUNK** reminder, privately tell
the Puzzlemaster the name of a non-Demon player. (_Do not say if they
guessed correctly or not._) Either way, mark the Puzzlemaster with the
**GUESS USED** reminder.
