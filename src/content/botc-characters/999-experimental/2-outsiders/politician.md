The Politician changes teams if they are losing.

- When the game ends, if the Politician was responsible for good losing,
  then the Politician turns evil and wins too.
- The player needs to be very influential when determining who wins.
  Simply spreading false information or voting for good players is
  usually not enough – they need to be the player that was more
  responsible for the good team losing than any other good player, and
  preferably more responsible than any one evil player too. The
  Storyteller is the judge of whether the Politician’s actions qualify.
- The Politician may still win with the good team, as normal.
- A drunk or poisoned Politician can not change teams.

## How To Run

When the game ends, if good lost and you feel that this was
significantly due to the words and actions of the Politician player,
declare that the Politician turns evil and wins too.

In the rare instance that the Politician is evil, and plays a big part
in losing the game for evil, declare that the Politician turns good and
wins with the good team.
