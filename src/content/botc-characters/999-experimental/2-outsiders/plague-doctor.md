tagLine: If you die, the Storyteller gains a Minion ability.
---

The Plague Doctor brings an extra Minion ability into play. The
Storyteller chooses which Minion ability is gained.

- This ability is in effect for the rest of the game.
- Nothing else changes for the Storyteller – they don’t become evil,
  they don’t become a player, they are not a legitimate player to be
  targeted by other abilities, and they cannot vote or nominate.
- If all Minions are in play, the Storyteller can gain an in-play Minion
  ability.
- If the Plague Doctor is drunk or poisoned when they die, the
  Storyteller doesn’t gain a Minion ability, even when the Plague Doctor
  becomes sober and healthy.

## How To Run

When the Plague Doctor dies, place a Minion character token in the
center of the left side of Grimoire. Mark this with the Plague Doctor’s
**STORYTELLER ABILITY** reminder. If applicable, add a night token to
the night sheet.

When this Minion would normally act, the relevant choices are made by
the Storyteller.
