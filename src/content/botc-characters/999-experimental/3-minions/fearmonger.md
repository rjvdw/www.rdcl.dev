The Fearmonger creates paranoia about who nominates whom.

- During the first night, when the Fearmonger selects a player, all
  players learn this.
- During other nights, each time the Fearmonger selects a new player,
  all players learn this. If the Fearmonger selects the same player as
  previously, the players learn nothing.
- The players only learn that the Fearmonger has acted, not which player
  was selected.
- If the Fearmonger nominates their chosen player, and that nomination
  results in their execution, the chosen player loses, their team loses,
  and the game ends.
- Only the currently chosen player is susceptible to the Fearmonger’s
  ability. Previously chosen players don’t count.
- If the chosen player is executed but does not die, the chosen player’s
  team still loses.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Fearmonger. They point at any player. Put the
Fearmonger to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the **FEAR** reminder.
If the Fearmonger chose a player who wasn’t already marked with the
**FEAR** reminder, declare that “The Fearmonger has chosen a player.”
(_This informs the group that the Fearmonger is alive and has chosen a
new player._)

If the Fearmonger nominates the player marked **FEAR**, and that
nomination results in their execution, declare that the game is over and
which team has won.
