The Marionette doesn't know that they are a Minion.

- The Marionette draws either a Townsfolk or an Outsider token from the
  bag, but is secretly the Marionette.
- The Marionette neighbors the Demon. There are no players sitting in
  between the Marionette and the Demon.
- The Demon knows which player is the Marionette.
- On the first night, the Marionette does not wake to learn the other
  evil players, and the other Minions do not learn the Marionette.
- The good ability that the Marionette thinks they have doesn’t work,
  but the Storyteller pretends it does. It is just as if this player is
  the Drunk.
- The Marionette registers as evil, and as a Minion.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, before putting tokens in the bag, remove the
Marionette token and add any Townsfolk token.

If there are three Minions in play, remove another Minion token and add
another Townsfolk token. During the first night, swap a good player’s
character token with a not-in-play Minion character token. Wake this
player, show them the **YOU ARE** info token then their Minion character
token, then the **YOU ARE** info token then a thumbs down, then put them
to sleep. This player is now an evil Minion. (_This ensures that only
one Minion token is in the bag, so at least one good player will
neighbor the Demon._)

During the first night, mark a good player neighboring the Demon with
the **IS THE MARIONETTE** reminder. Wake the Demon. Point to the player
marked **IS THE MARIONETTE** and show the Marionette character token.
Put the Demon to sleep.

Treat the Marionette as if they were drunk. They wake when their good
character would wake, may get false information, do not wake during the
Minion Info step etc.
