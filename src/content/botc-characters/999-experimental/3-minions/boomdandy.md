  If you are executed, all but 3 players die. 1 minute later, the player
  with the most players pointing at them, dies.

The Boomdandy explodes when executed, killing most other players.

- If the Boomdandy is executed, the Storyteller kills other players, one
  at a time, until only three are left alive.
- The Demon will be one of the remaining three players (otherwise, the
  game would be over).
- The players have one minute to decide who to kill next. There is no
  further nomination or execution today. Instead, all players point at
  the player they want to die. When one minute is up, the Storyteller
  counts the number of fingers pointed at each player. If it is a tie,
  then night falls (and evil probably wins due to the Demon killing that
  night).
- Even dead players who have no vote token may point.
- Players may change who they are pointing at up until the minute ends,
  at which point their decision is final.
- The Boomdandy only explodes due to an execution. Deaths by other
  means, such as via a Golem or a Psychopath, don’t count. If the
  Boomdandy is executed but doesn’t die (due to a Devil’s Advocate
  etc.), they still explode.
- If a character can’t die, such as the Fool or the Sailor, the
  Storyteller may rule that four players remain alive after a Boomdandy
  explosion.

## How To Run

If the Boomdandy is executed, declare that the Boomdandy has exploded.
Enter the circle, put your hand out towards the Boomdandy, and rotate
around the circle. (_Similar to running a vote._) When your hand reaches
a living player, say “You live” or say “You die” as that player
**dies**. When you have completed the circle, three players will be
alive, including the Demon. Then, set a timer on a watch or phone for
one minute. When the time runs out, ask all players to immediately
freeze (to stay still) while you count the number of players who are
pointing at each player. The player with the most fingers pointed at
them, **dies**. This will end the game, since just two players are
alive, so declare which team has won.
