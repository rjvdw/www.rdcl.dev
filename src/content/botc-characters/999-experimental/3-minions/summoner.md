  You get 3 bluffs. On the 3rd night, choose a player: they become an
  evil Demon of your choice. [No Demon]

The Summoner creates a Demon.

- The Summoner may choose any player to become the Demon, even
  themselves.
- The new Demon does not learn which players are Minions, or vice versa.
  The evil players will need to talk amongst themselves to figure this
  out.
- Even though there is no Demon in play for two days, the game does not
  end. However, if the Summoner becomes unable to create a Demon (due to
  dying, becoming drunk on night 3 etc.) good wins.
- The newly created Demon acts on the same night that it is created.

## How To Run

During the setup phase, remove the Demon and add a Townsfolk.

When preparing the first night, put the Summoner’s **NIGHT 1** reminder
by the Summoner. When preparing the second night, put the Summoner’s
**NIGHT 2** reminder by the Summoner. When preparing the third night,
put the Summoner’s **NIGHT 3** reminder by the Summoner.

During the first night, show the Summoner 3 not-in-play characters as
bluffs.

During the night, if the Summoner has a **NIGHT 3** reminder, wake the
Summoner. They point at a player, and to a Demon icon on the character
sheet. Put the Summoner to sleep. Wake the chosen player. Show the **YOU
ARE** info token, then the Demon token. Show the **YOU ARE** info token,
then give a thumbs down. Replace their character token with the Demon
token and put the new Demon to sleep.
