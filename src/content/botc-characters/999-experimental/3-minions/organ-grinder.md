The Organ Grinder makes voting secret.

- When a player is nominated, players vote with eyes closed.
- The Storyteller does not count the votes out loud, and does not reveal
  how many players voted once voting is complete.
- The Storyteller does not reveal which player is “about to die”.
- After nominations have closed, the Storyteller reveals which player is
  executed, as normal.
- Dead players may vote once if they have a vote token. Their vote token
  is removed at the end of the day instead of after the vote.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Organ Grinder. The Organ Grinder either nods or
shakes their head. If they nod their head, mark them with the **DRUNK**
reminder. If they shake their head, remove their **DRUNK** reminder. Put
the Organ Grinder to sleep.

When a player has been nominated and a vote is just about to begin, and
the Organ Grinder is sober, ask all players to close their eyes. If they
ask why, tell them that an Organ Grinder is in play. When counting
votes, do so silently. Afterwards, do not reveal how many players voted,
nor if the nominee is “about to die”. If there were enough votes to
execute the nominee, mark them with the **ABOUT TO DIE** reminder. Ask
players to open their eyes, and if there are any more nominations.

When nominations are closed, declare that the player marked **ABOUT TO
DIE**, is executed.
