  The Demon (even if drunk or poisoned) has a not-in-play good
  character's ability. You both know which.

The Boffin replicates a good ability.

- While the Boffin is alive, the Demon has a single Townsfolk ability or
  Outsider ability.
- If the Demon is drunk or poisoned, the Demon keeps this good ability.
  If the Boffin is drunk or poisoned, the Demon temporarily loses this
  good ability.
- If the Demon dies and has an ability that functions while dead, such
  as the Sweetheart, the Demon keeps this ability.
- If a new Demon is created, such as via a Scarlet Woman or a Barber,
  this new Demon has an ability from the Boffin. This ability may be
  different to the previous Demon's ability.
- If there are multiple Demons alive, only one alive Demon has an
  ability from the Boffin.
- If the Demon has an ability that modifies the setup, such as a
  Choirboy, these changes are made during setup, as normal.
- Both the Demon and the Boffin learn which good ability the Demon has.
  The Storyteller may wake these players independently, or together.
- The not-in-play character may be 1 of the Demon's 3 bluffs.
- The Demon also wakes at night at the time that the **good** character
  would normally wake.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag,
make any changes that are indicated in brackets on the Demon's two
character abilities. Afterwards, place this second character token by
the Demon character token.

During the 1st night, wake the Boffin and the Demon. Show the **THIS
CHARACTER SELECTED YOU** info token, then the Boffin token, then the
good character token. Place this second character token by the Demon
character token.

Treat the Demon player as if they had this character ability, as well as
their own Demon ability.
