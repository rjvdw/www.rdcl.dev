  Each day, before nominations, you may publicly choose a player: they
  die. If executed, you only die if you lose roshambo.

The Psychopath kills in broad daylight.

- During the day, if the Psychopath declares that they are the
  Psychopath and publicly chooses a player, that player dies. This can
  only be done once per day, and only before the Storyteller has called
  for nominations.
- The Psychopath does not need to use this ability if they donâ€™t want
  to.
- The Psychopath can be nominated and voted for normally. If the
  Psychopath is executed, they might not die. They play Roshambo
  (Paper-Rock-Scissors) with the player that nominated them. The
  nominator needs to win for the Psychopath to die. Drawing or losing
  means the Psychopath lives.
- If the Psychopath is executed, this still counts as the one execution
  for the day. No more players may be nominated or executed today.
- If the Psychopath dies by other means, such as the Demon attacking
  them, they do not play Roshambo. They die.

## How To Run

Once per day, before you have called for nominations, the Psychopath may
publicly choose a player. That player **dies**.

If the Psychopath is executed, the Psychopath and the nominator play a
game of Roshambo. If the Psychopath loses, they **die**. If the
Psychopath draws or wins, they live. Either way, the day ends, since
there is only one execution per day.

If the Psychopath is executed due to a self-nomination, then the
Psychopath plays Roshambo with you instead.
