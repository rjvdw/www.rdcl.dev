The Mezepheles offers good players a choice: to turn evil or not.

- On the first night, the Mezepheles learns a secret word from the
  Storyteller.
- If a good player says this word, either publicly or privately, they
  turn evil that night. The Storyteller needs to hear this player
  actually say the word before turning them evil.
- The Mezepheles does not learn if a player turns evil. The good player
  learns if they turn evil, but not until that night.
- If the Mezepheles is sober and healthy at night, the good player turns
  evil even if the Mezepheles was drunk or poisoned when the good player
  spoke the secret word. If the Mezepheles is drunk or poisoned at night
  when a player would turn evil, the player stays good—the Mezepheles
  has “used their ability” and may not turn a player evil later on.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, write a single word on a piece of paper or on
a phone or other device. During the first night, wake the Mezepheles,
show the written word, then put them to sleep.

The first time you hear a good player say the secret word, mark them
with the **TURNS EVIL** reminder.

Each night, if a player is marked with the **TURNS EVIL** reminder, wake
them. Show the **YOU ARE** info token then give a thumbs down. Put them
to sleep. Turn their character token upside down. (This shows they are
now evil.) **The Mezepheles loses their ability**—mark them with the
**NO ABILITY** reminder and remove their night token from the night
sheet.
