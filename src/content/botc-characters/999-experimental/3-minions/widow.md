The Widow knows all characters and poisons the exact person they think
is most useful.

## How To Run

On their first night, wake the Widow and show them the Grimoire for as
long as they need. The Widow points to a character token in the
Grimoire, or a player. Mark that player with a **POISONED** reminder.
Put the Widow to sleep. Wake any good player. Show them the Widow
character token. Put that good player to sleep.

If the Widow dies or changes character, their poison ends. Likewise,
their poison vanishes while the Widow is poisoned/drunk. When a Widow
poisons a player, night 1 has already begun, so it does not prevent any
[setup] abilities from taking effect.

If a Widow is created mid-game, execute the first paragraph of the how
to run just like you would if they were in play on night 1 – it’s the
Widow’s first night that matters for their ability, not how many nights
into the whole game you are.

If the Widow chooses to poison themselves, no-one is informed that a
Widow is in play.

Only the Preacher, Sailor and Poisoner can prevent the Widow from
getting to poison on night 1 and in all of these cases, a good player
would be told that the Widow is in play once the preaching/drunk/poison
wears off. If Sailor drunked or Poisoner poisoned, the Widow can be
shown a fake grimoire. Also, their poison choice has no effect for the
rest of the game, even if they become sober/healthy later. If preached,
the Widow is merely shown the Preacher in play and does not see the
grimoire, even if the Preacher is dead/poisoned/drunk later in the game.

If the good player who knows the Widow is in play turns evil while the
Widow is alive, wake a new good player and show them the Widow character
token.
