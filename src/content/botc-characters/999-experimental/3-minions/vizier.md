  All players know who you are. You can not die during the day. If good
  voted, you may choose to execute immediately.

The Vizier executes players without the townâ€™s consent.

- On the first day, all players learn that the Vizier is in play, and
  which player it is.
- During the day, the Vizier can not die by any means.
- After a vote is tallied, if the Vizier chooses to execute the nominee
  (and at least one good player voted), they are executed immediately.
  This counts as the 1 execution allowed each day.
- After a vote is tallied, if the Vizier chooses to execute the nominee
  (and no good players voted), nothing happens.
- Even if the vote tally is less than 50% of the living players, the
  Vizier may still execute. Even if another player has more votes than
  the current player, the Vizier may still execute.
- The Vizier does not have to force an execution each day.

## How To Run

When the first night has ended, declare that the Vizier is in play, and
which player it is.

If a vote has just been tallied, and one or more good players voted, and
the Vizier declares that the nominee is executed, that player is
executed and dies. No more nominations, votes, or executions occur
today.
