  If you publicly claim to be the Goblin when nominated & are executed
  that day, your team wins.

The Goblin takes revenge if the town knowingly executes them.

- If the Goblin is executed, evil wins.
- ...but for this to happen the Goblin needs to tell the group that they
  are the Goblin when they are nominated, but before votes happen, and
  to do so in a way that everyone hears. The good players need to know
  the risk.
- If the Goblin is executed without telling the group that they are the
  Goblin when nominated, the Goblin dies and the game continues as
  normal.
- The Goblin must have claimed to be the Goblin today for their ability
  to work. Telling the group yesterday, or even every previous day,
  doesn't count.
- Any player may claim to be the Goblin when nominated.

## How To Run

If the Goblin claims to be the Goblin when nominated (and before voting
begins), declare that this player has claimed to be the Goblin, so that
all the group hears. Put the **CLAIMED** reminder by the Goblin token.

If the Goblin is executed, and they are marked **CLAIMED**, then declare
that evil wins.
