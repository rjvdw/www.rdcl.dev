  Each night, choose 2 players: tomorrow, the 1st player is mad that the
  2nd is evil, or one or both might die.

The Harpy creates discord and distrust between good players.

- At night, the Harpy player chooses one player at a time, not two at
  once.
- A player chosen by the Harpy is affected by the ability until the next
  Harpy choice.
- If the Storyteller decides to kill players with the Harpy ability,
  they do not need to kill both. The Storyteller can decide to kill only
  one, or none.
- The Harpy can choose a dead player. If so, the Storyteller can kill
  just the living player, since dead players can not die again.
- The order of deaths due to the Harpy ability can be chosen by the
  Storyteller, should that be important.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Harpy. The Harpy points to one player, then another
player. Mark the first player with the **MAD** reminder and the second
player with the **2ND** reminder. Put the Harpy to sleep. Wake the
player marked **MAD**. Show the **THIS CHARACTER SELECTED YOU** info
token then the Harpy token, then point to the player marked **2ND**. Put
the player marked “Mad” to sleep.

Tomorrow, if the player marked “mad” is not mad that the player marked
“2nd” is evil, you may kill one or both players.
