  Once per day, you may choose to kill an alive neighbor, if your other
  alive neighbor agrees.

The Gangster lets their neighbours kill each other.

- The Gangster may kill one of their two living neighbors. Their dead
  neighbors are skipped over, and do not count.
- To use their ability, the Gangster and one of their living neighbors
  must agree to kill the other living neighbor. The Storyteller must
  hear and confirm this agreement. The Gangster cannot kill without the
  Storyteller present.
- Each day, the Gangster may say whatever they want, and offer any
  encouraging words they want to either player. Once an agreement has
  been reached, then the Gangster may not use their ability again today,
  even if that player didn’t die due to an ability protecting them.
- The Gangster’s two living neighbors are always one clockwise, and one
  counter-clockwise.
- If both living neighbors want to kill the other, the Gangster decides
  who dies.

## How To Run

Once per day, the Gangster can declare that they wish to use their
ability. If so, ask if an alive neighbor agrees. If an alive neighbor
agrees, the other alive neighbor **dies**. If both alive neighbors
agree, the Gangster chooses which alive neighbor **dies**. If neither
alive neighbor agrees, the Gangster may not use their ability today.
