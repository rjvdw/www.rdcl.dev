  All players start knowing a player of your alignment. You may choose

The Gnome protects one player on their team.

- The Gnome starts as the same alignment as one other player - their
  "amigo". The Storyteller publicly announces which player this is.
- When their amigo is nominated, it is the Gnome's responsibility to
  speak up. The Storyteller may not prompt them to use their ability.
- If their amigo changes alignment, the Gnome's alignment does not
  change.
- The Gnome may use their ability any number of times over the course of
  the game, including zero. Their amigo may still only be nominated once
  per day.
- When the Gnome uses their ability, and the Storyteller confirms it,
  the nominator dies immediately. Voting for execution still occurs.
- Regardless of what the group wants, it is always the individual
  player's decision whether they wish to nominate or not, and always the
  Gnome player's decision on whether they wish to use their ability or
  not. If the Storyteller feels that a player is being pressured into
  nominating or using their ability when they don't want to, the
  Storyteller may not recognize that nomination or ability use.

## How To Run

During the day, as soon as the Gnome has entered play, mark a player of
the same alignment with the **AMIGO** reminder. Declare that this player
is the same alignment as the Gnome.

If this player is nominated, but before you have started the voting
process, if the Gnome player declares that they wish to use their
ability, the nominator **dies**.
