  Each night*, choose a player: they die. You start by choosing a
  player: they are poisoned. You die if & only if they are dead.

The Lleech lives if their host lives, and dies if their host dies.

- On the first night, the Lleech chooses a player, who is poisoned for
  the rest of the game.
- If this player is alive, the Lleech cannot die. If the Lleech is
  executed, the Storyteller tells the group that the player lives, but
  not why.
- If the player that the Lleech chose dies, the Lleech dies as well. If
  this means that only one or two players are left alive, good still
  wins, because the Demon is dead.
- From the second night onwards, players that the Lleech attacks die but
  are not poisoned.

## How To Run

During the first night, wake the Lleech. They point at any player. That
player is **poisoned**—mark them with the **POISONED** reminder. Put the
Lleech to sleep.

Each night except the first, wake the Lleech. They point at any player.
That player **dies**—mark them with the **DEAD** reminder. Put the
Lleech to sleep.

If the Lleech would die but the player marked with the Lleech’s
**POISONED** reminder is alive, the Lleech does not die. If the player
marked with the Lleech’s **POISONED** reminder **is dead**, the Lleech
**dies** and the good team wins.
