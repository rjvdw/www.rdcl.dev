The Kazali chooses their own Minions.

- If a Kazali is created mid game, the Kazali does not choose new Minion
  players.
- The Storyteller can give the Minions’ original good characters as
  bluffs to the Demon, since they are not in play.
- The Kazali acts at a time that is technically both during setup and
  during the first night.
- The Storyteller may keep the Kazali awake, or put the Kazali to sleep,
  when waking the Minions to tell them which Minion that they are.
- Only Minions that are on the script may be chosen. Duplicate Minion
  characters are not allowed.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, remove all Minion tokens and add Townsfolk or
Outsider tokens.

During the first night, wake the Kazali. The Kazali points at a player
and a Minion on the character sheet. Replace their old character token
with the Minion token, show them the “You Are” info token then the
Minion character token, and give a thumbs down. Repeat until the normal
number of Minions exist. Put the Kazali to sleep.

Each night except the first, wake the Kazali. They point at any player.
That player dies.
