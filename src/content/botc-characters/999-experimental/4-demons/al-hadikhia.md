      The Al-Hadikhia chooses 3 players. Announce the first player, wake
      them to nod yes to live or shake head no to die, kill or resurrect
      accordingly, then put to sleep and announce the next player. If
      all 3 are alive after this, all 3 die.

The Al-Hadikhia puts three players in a dilemma – who will choose to
die, so that others can live?

- The Al-Hadikhia chooses three players per night. Everyone learns which
  three were chosen. Each player makes their choice before the next
  player is revealed.
- All players must be silent when the Al-Hadikhia acts at night. This
  period lasts from when the Storyteller first declares that a player
  has been chosen, until the Storyteller says that it ends.
- At night, the Storyteller asks players out loud if they choose to
  live. If they nod their head, they live. If they shake their head,
  they die. Players may be brought back to life this way.
- If all players choose to live, then they all die instead. If a living
  player chose to die but did not die, they count as alive for this
  calculation.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Al-Hadikhia. They point at three
players. Mark these players with the **1**, **2** and **3** reminders,
in the order the Al-Hadikhia chose. Put the Al-Hadikhia to sleep. Wake
the player marked **1** and say “The Al-Hadikhia has chosen” then the
name of the player, then “Do you choose to live?” They either nod or
shake their head. Put them to sleep. If they chose to live, remove their
shroud (_if any_), and if they choose to **die**, add a shroud. Repeat
for players marked **2** then **3**. If all three players are alive
(_none of them have a shroud_) then add a shroud to all three. They
**die**. Declare that the time of silence has ended.

Each dawn, declare which players marked **1**, **2** and **3** are alive
and which are dead. Do this even if a player’s alive or dead status did
not change during the night.
