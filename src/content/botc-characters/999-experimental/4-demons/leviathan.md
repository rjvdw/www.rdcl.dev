The Leviathan doesn't kill.

- All players know the Leviathan is in play, even if the Leviathan is
  created mid-game.
- Any number of evil players may be executed, but if more than one good
  player is executed, evil wins. It doesn’t matter which characters were
  executed, only the alignment of the player at the time they were
  executed.
- When the fifth day ends and night begins, if the Leviathan is still
  alive, evil wins.
- All types of execution count, even if the player doesn’t die. A player
  executed due to the Virgin, or due to revealing that they are the
  Mutant, is still executed. An executed player who lives due to the
  Pacifist is still executed.

## How To Run

Immediately after dawn on the first day, declare that the Leviathan is
in play. Mark the Leviathan with the **DAY 1** reminder. At the
beginning of each following day, mark the Leviathan with **DAY 2**, then
**DAY 3**, then **DAY 4**, then **DAY 5** reminders. If a day ends and
the Leviathan is marked with the **DAY 5** reminder, declare that evil
wins.

If a good player is executed, mark them with the **GOOD PLAYER
EXECUTED** reminder.

If a good player is executed and a player is already marked with the
**GOOD PLAYER EXECUTED** reminder, declare that evil wins.
