  Each night*, choose a character: they die. If they are not in play,
  the Storyteller chooses who dies.
---

The Ojo chooses specifically which character dies.

- Unlike other Demons, the Ojo must choose a character, not a player.
  The Storyteller may need to remind the player of this. We recommend
  that all players have their character sheet handy during the night
  phase.
- The Ojo can kill evil characters, if they wish.
- If there are multiple copies of a particular character in play, and
  the Ojo chooses that character to die, only one of those characters
  dies.
- If the Ojo chooses a character that is not in play, the Storyteller
  will almost always kill a living good player. It is possible, but
  uncommon, for the Storyteller to choose a dead player or an evil
  player to die.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Ojo. The Ojo player points to a
character icon on their character sheet. If that character is in play,
that player dies—mark them with the “Dead” reminder. If that character
is not in play, choose any player. That player dies—mark them with the
“Dead” reminder. Put the Ojo to sleep.
