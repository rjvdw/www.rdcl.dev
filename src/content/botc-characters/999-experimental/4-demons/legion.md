Legion is many Demons.

- The recommended number of good and evil players is the reverse of the
  normal. For example, for a ten player game, there are roughly seven
  Legion and three good players.
- The players that are not Legion may be Townsfolk or Outsiders, in any
  combination.
- If at least one good player voted for the nomination, and that player
  is “about to die”, then the execution happens as normal. If only evil
  players vote for a nomination, the vote tally for that nominee is
  zero.
- Each Legion registers as a Minion as well as a Demon.
- The Storyteller chooses which player dies at night.
- If only one good player remains alive, the Storyteller may declare
  that evil wins, since good cannot win.
- The Storyteller can decide not to give Legion players bluffs.

## How To Run

During the first night, during the Demon Info step, let all Legion
players make eye contact. (_You may want to point to the non-Legion
players so that Legion knows who they are._)

Each night except the first, you may decide that a player dies. When
counting votes, count out loud, as normal. If the vote tally is enough
to make a player **ABOUT TO DIE** but only evil players voted, declare
that the vote tally is zero.
