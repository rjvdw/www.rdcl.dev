The Lord of Typhon is surrounded by Minions.

- All evil characters sit next to each other in a continuous line. All
  evil characters (including Travellers and evil Townsfolk) must be in
  the line at setup.
- If Lord of Typhon is on the script, the Storyteller decides where
  Travellers sit, even if the Lord of Typhon is not in play.
- The Lord of Typhon must have an evil character on both sides. They
  cannot sit at the end of the line of evil characters.
- The evil team starts with one additional Minion.
- Any number of Outsiders might be in play.
- Like the Marionette, the Storyteller decides which players are Minions
  during setup. The Storyteller also decides which player is which
  Minion.
- If a Lord of Typhon is created mid game, the Lord of Typhon does not
  need to sit in a line with the evil characters.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, remove all Minion tokens and add Townsfolk or
Outsider tokens.

During the first night, wake the appropriate number of players directly
clockwise and counter-clockwise from the Lord of Typhon. Show each of
these players a unique Minion token, and give a thumbs down. Replace
these players’ good character tokens with these Minion tokens and put
these players to sleep. Then, do the Minion Info and Demon Info steps as
normal.

Each night except the first, wake the Lord of Typhon. They point at any
player. That player **dies** — mark them with the **DEAD** reminder. Put
the Lord of Typhon to sleep.
