## How To Run

During setup, write a phrase on a piece of paper, or on a phone.

During the first night, wake the Demon. Show this phrase, then put them
to sleep.

Each time Demon says the secret phrase, put a **DEAD** reminder in the
centre of the left side of the Grimoire, as a reminder to yourself to
place it tonight.

Each night, you may mark players with these **DEAD** reminders, and add
a shroud to each marked player. These players die.
