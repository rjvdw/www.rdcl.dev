  Nominees die, but may nominate again immediately (on day 3, they

Riot kills everybody in a panic.

- Each player that is nominated dies immediately. Even though they are
  dead, they may nominate again today. This may happen multiple times
  per day.
- The player that was nominated must nominate again immediately or lose
  their chance to do so. The Storyteller counts down “3... 2... 1...” to
  let the player know how long they have to nominate, should they wish
  to. If they don’t, no more nominations are allowed today.
- The good team wins if all Riot players are dead. If the last Riot dies
  and only two players are alive, they do not nominate, and the good
  team wins.
- On the third day, each nominated player must nominate again. If they
  do not, the Storyteller will nominate on their behalf, or declare that
  that player’s team loses.
- If just three players are alive when the third day nominations begin,
  the group chooses which player nominates first. If no one nominates,
  the day ends and evil wins.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, before putting the character tokens in the
bag, replace all Minion tokens with Riot tokens. During the first night,
skip the Minion Info step. During the Demon Info step, wake all Riot
players and allow them to make eye contact. Show each Riot player three
character bluffs, then put them to sleep.

Each time a player is nominated, they **die**. Declare that they are
dead, and add a shroud immediately. Tell them that they may nominate
again. Publicly count down “3... 2... 1...” and if they nominate before
their time runs out, repeat this process for the new nominee (_they
**die**, may nominate etc._) If they do not nominate before their time
runs out, the day ends.

On the third day, nominated players **die** and must nominate again. If
the day ends with more than two players alive, evil wins.
