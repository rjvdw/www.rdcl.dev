Lil’ Monsta isn’t a player, and is instead babysat by a Minion.

- Each night, all Minions wake together and decide amongst themselves
  who babysits the Lil’ Monsta. The Minions decide by pointing to a
  player, or otherwise make it obvious they have reached a decision. If
  they can not reach a unanimous decision, the Storyteller decides.
- If the Storyteller thinks it is funny, they may give this player the
  Lil’ Monsta token, which they will need to hide in a pocket, under
  their hat, or somewhere appropriate. Players may not request that
  others empty their pockets.
- The player with the Lil’ Monsta token “is the Demon”. Good wins if
  they die. They register as a Demon for characters like the Fortune
  Teller etc.
- If a good player babysits Lil’ Monsta, they “are the Demon” but they
  remain good. A dead player babysitting Lil’ Monsta ends the game
  because the Demon “is dead”.
- Minions babysitting Lil’ Monsta keep their Minion ability.
- Lil’ Monsta isn’t a player, so can’t be drunk or poisoned.

## How To Run

During setup, remove Lil’ Monsta and add a Minion token. On the first
night, skip the **MINION INFO** and **DEMON INFO** steps.

Each night, wake all Minions. The majority will (eventually) point to
one player. If they can’t decide, choose a player. (Give this player the
Lil’ Monsta token and wait for them to hide it, if you want!) Mark them
with the **IS THE DEMON** reminder token. Put all Minions to sleep.
Then, if it is not the first night, a player might **die** – mark them
with a **DEAD** reminder and a shroud.

The player marked **IS THE DEMON** registers as the Demon. If they die,
declare that the game is over and good has won.
