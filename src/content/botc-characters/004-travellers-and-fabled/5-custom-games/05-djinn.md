  Use the Djinn's special rule. All players know what it is.

Add the Djinn to all games with a jinx icon on the script. The Djinn
resolves jinxes by creating a unique rule.

- When creating a character list using the Script Tool, some character
  combinations will be marked as unusual. These two characters are
  jinxed—they have abilities that clash or contradict each other in some
  way. The Djinn creates a special rule that allows these characters to
  work well together. Some jinxed characters even work better with the
  Djinn in play!
- The Djinn’s special rule is described by the Script Tool online, and
  is printed out automatically when you create a script with a character
  combination that is jinxed.
- There are many different Djinn special rules. Each is tailored to a
  specific pair of jinxed characters.
- If there are jinxed characters on the character sheet, even if there
  are no jinxed characters in play, the Storyteller tells all players
  what the Djinn’s special rule is at the start of the game.
- The Djinn may have several special rules at once. If there are
  multiple pairs of jinxed characters on the character sheet, the
  players learn all the Djinn’s special rules.

## How To Run

At the start of the game, if there are jinxed characters on the
character sheet, declare that the Djinn is in play and inform the group
of all Djinn special rules for this game. (_Do this even if there are no
jinxed characters in play._)

Follow the Djinn instructions as listed on the Script Tool printout.
