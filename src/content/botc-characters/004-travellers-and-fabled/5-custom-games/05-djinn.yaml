game: Custom Game
tagLine: Use the Djinn's special rule. All players know what it is.
description: |
  Add the Djinn to all games with a jinx icon on the script. The Djinn
  resolves jinxes by creating a unique rule.

  - When creating a character list using the Script Tool, some character
    combinations will be marked as unusual. These two characters are
    jinxed—they have abilities that clash or contradict each other in
    some way. The Djinn creates a special rule that allows these
    characters to work well together. Some jinxed characters even work
    better with the Djinn in play!
  - The Djinn’s special rule is described by the Script Tool online, and
    is printed out automatically when you create a script with a
    character combination that is jinxed.
  - There are many different Djinn special rules. Each is tailored to a
    specific pair of jinxed characters.
  - If there are jinxed characters on the character sheet, even if there
    are no jinxed characters in play, the Storyteller tells all players
    what the Djinn’s special rule is at the start of the game.
  - The Djinn may have several special rules at once. If there are
    multiple pairs of jinxed characters on the character sheet, the
    players learn all the Djinn’s special rules.
howToRun: |
  At the start of the game, if there are jinxed characters on the
  character sheet, declare that the Djinn is in play and inform the
  group of all Djinn special rules for this game. (*Do this even if
  there are no jinxed characters in play.*)

  Follow the Djinn instructions as listed on the Script Tool printout.
