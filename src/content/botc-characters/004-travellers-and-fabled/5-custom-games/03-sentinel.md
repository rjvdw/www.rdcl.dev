Add the Sentinel to your script to keep the number of Outsiders in play
mysterious.

- The official character lists are carefully constructed so that the
  number of Outsiders is never completely known, which lets evil players
  safely bluff as Outsiders. Many of the games you create using the
  Script Tool will not have this luxury. If, for one reason or another,
  the number of Outsiders in a game will become certain, the Storyteller
  can add a Sentinel. This will confuse matters and help the evil team
  either bluff as Outsiders or make existing Outsiders look suspicious.
- Games with a Sentinel in play might have one more Outsider than
  normal. They may have one less. They may have the normal amount. It is
  up to the Storyteller.

## How To Run

At the start of the game, declare that the Sentinel is in play. Add the
Sentinel token to the Grimoire.

While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag,
add an Outsider token and remove a Townsfolk token, remove an Outsider
token and add a Townsfolk token, or do neither.
