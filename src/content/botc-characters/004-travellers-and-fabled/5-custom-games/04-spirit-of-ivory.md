Add the Spirit of Ivory to your script to keep the number of evil
players fair and balanced.

- When creating character lists using the Script Tool, it is a good idea
  to include no more than one character that adds evil characters. If
  two or more players turn evil, then the evil team can win simply by
  revealing who they are and winning due to their voting majority.
  Adding the Spirit of Ivory prevents too many players turning evil,
  creating a more fun and fair game for the good players.
- With a Spirit of Ivory in play, only one more player than normal can
  ever be evil. If a second player would become evil, they stay good
  instead.
- The normal number of evil players is printed on the Traveller sheet
  and on the Setup sheet.

## How To Run

At the start of the game, declare that the Spirit of Ivory is in play.
Add the Spirit of Ivory token and their reminder token to the Grimoire.

At all times, if there is an extra evil character in play, mark the
Spirit of Ivory with the **NO MORE EVIL** reminder. (_If any character
becomes good, remove the reminder._)

If a player would become evil and the Spirit of Ivory is marked **NO
MORE EVIL**, that player stays good.
