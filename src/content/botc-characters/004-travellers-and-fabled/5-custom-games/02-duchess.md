Add the Duchess if your script has too little information or too much
misinformation.

- Sometimes, you may want to create a character list using the Script
  Tool that has hardly any good characters that gain information
  directly. Whilst having an abundance of abilities and a lack of
  information can be fun for some players, other players like something
  more. The Duchess adds regular information to such a game.
- Each player that visits the Duchess learns how many visitors are evil,
  including themself. However, one visitor of the Storyteller’s choice
  will get false information.
- Players that visit the Duchess still get to use their ability
  normally. The Duchess does not make their ability give false
  information.
- The players decide amongst themselves which players will be the three
  players to visit. If exactly three visitors cannot be decided upon,
  then the Duchess does not act tonight.

## How To Run

At the start of the game, declare that the Duchess is in play. Add the
Duchess token and their reminders to the Grimoire. Each day, any player
may volunteer to visit the Duchess tonight.

If exactly three players volunteer to visit the Duchess tonight, then
mark two of them with a **VISITOR** reminder and one of them with a
**FALSE INFO** reminder. If more or less than three players volunteer to
visit, do not add these reminders.

At night, wake each player marked **VISITOR** or **FALSE INFO** one at a
time. Show the woken player the Duchess token. If the woken player is
marked **VISITOR**, show them fingers (0, 1, 2, or 3) equaling the
number of evil players who are marked either **VISITOR** or **FALSE
INFO**. If the woken player is marked **FALSE INFO**, show them any
number of fingers except the correct number. Put the woken player to
sleep.

Remove the Duchess at any time, declaring when you do so.
