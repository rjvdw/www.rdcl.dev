type: Fabled
game: Custom Game
tagLine: Once per game, 1 good player might get incorrect information.
description: |
  Add the Fibbin if your script has too much information or no
  possibility of misinformation.

  - If you create a character list and it has no characters that cause
    drunkenness, poisoning, or other ways for information to be false,
    then you may want to add the Fibbin. Whilst it is not necessary,
    even a minor chance of a good player’s information being incorrect
    can drastically help the evil players bluff.
  - The Fibbin does not make an ability fail in the way that drunkenness
    and poisoning do. It only affects abilities that provide information
    from the Storyteller signaling to a player during the night or
    telling them something.
  - If the game ends before you have given a good player incorrect
    information, that’s okay.
  - Some characters get false information due to their ability. The
    Fibbin can make this information true.
howToRun: |
  At the start of the game, declare that the Fibbin is in play. Add the
  Fibbin token to the Grimoire.

  Once per game, when a good player gains information from an ability,
  you can give them incorrect information. **The Fibbin loses their
  ability**—put their **NO ABILITY** reminder token by their token.
