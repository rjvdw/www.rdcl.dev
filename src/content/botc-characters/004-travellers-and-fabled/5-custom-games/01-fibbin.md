Add the Fibbin if your script has too much information or no possibility
of misinformation.

- If you create a character list and it has no characters that cause
  drunkenness, poisoning, or other ways for information to be false,
  then you may want to add the Fibbin. Whilst it is not necessary, even
  a minor chance of a good player’s information being incorrect can
  drastically help the evil players bluff.
- The Fibbin does not make an ability fail in the way that drunkenness
  and poisoning do. It only affects abilities that provide information
  from the Storyteller signaling to a player during the night or telling
  them something.
- If the game ends before you have given a good player incorrect
  information, that’s okay.
- Some characters get false information due to their ability. The Fibbin
  can make this information true.

## How To Run

At the start of the game, declare that the Fibbin is in play. Add the
Fibbin token to the Grimoire.

Once per game, when a good player gains information from an ability, you
can give them incorrect information. **The Fibbin loses their
ability**—put their **NO ABILITY** reminder token by their token.
