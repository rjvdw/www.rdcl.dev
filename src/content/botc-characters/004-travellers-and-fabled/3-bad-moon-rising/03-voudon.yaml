  Only you & the dead can vote. They don't need a vote token to do so. A
  50% majority isn't required.

  The Voudon gives the voting power to the dead instead of the living.

  - The dead and the Voudon may vote as many times per day as they wish.
    They do not need a vote token to vote, and do not lose their vote
    token when they do so. Alive players cannot vote. It is not the case
    that they may put their hand up but the votes don’t count—their
    hands must stay down during voting.
  - The number of votes required to execute a player is no longer half
    or more of the alive players. The player with the most votes is
    executed each day, but even a single vote is enough to execute a
    player if no other player gets more votes.
  - The Voudon does not alter who can make nominations. As normal, alive
    players may make nominations, and dead players may not. Since
    Travellers are exiled, not executed, all players, alive or dead, may
    support exiling the Voudon or other Travellers.
  - If a player is about to die and then the Voudon is exiled, that
    player is still about to die and nominations continue, but alive
    players vote as normal. If a later nomination gets more votes and it
    tallies to half or more of the alive players, this new player is
    about to die instead.
howToRun: |
  During votes for execution, only dead players and the Voudon may raise
  their hand to vote. The dead may vote even if they have no vote token,
  and voting does not use a vote token. If a nominee gets at least one
  vote, they are about to die by execution until a different player gets
  more votes
