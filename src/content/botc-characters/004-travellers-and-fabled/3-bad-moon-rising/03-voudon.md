  Only you & the dead can vote. They don't need a vote token to do so. A
  50% majority isn't required.

The Voudon gives the voting power to the dead instead of the living.

- The dead and the Voudon may vote as many times per day as they wish.
  They do not need a vote token to vote, and do not lose their vote
  token when they do so. Alive players cannot vote. It is not the case
  that they may put their hand up but the votes don’t count—their hands
  must stay down during voting.
- The number of votes required to execute a player is no longer half or
  more of the alive players. The player with the most votes is executed
  each day, but even a single vote is enough to execute a player if no
  other player gets more votes.
- The Voudon does not alter who can make nominations. As normal, alive
  players may make nominations, and dead players may not. Since
  Travellers are exiled, not executed, all players, alive or dead, may
  support exiling the Voudon or other Travellers.
- If a player is about to die and then the Voudon is exiled, that player
  is still about to die and nominations continue, but alive players vote
  as normal. If a later nomination gets more votes and it tallies to
  half or more of the alive players, this new player is about to die
  instead.

## How To Run

During votes for execution, only dead players and the Voudon may raise
their hand to vote. The dead may vote even if they have no vote token,
and voting does not use a vote token. If a nominee gets at least one
vote, they are about to die by execution until a different player gets
more votes
