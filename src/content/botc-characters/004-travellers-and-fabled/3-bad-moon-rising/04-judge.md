  Once per game, if another player nominated, you may choose to force
  the current execution to pass or fail.

The Judge can determine if an execution succeeds or not, regardless of
who voted.

- The Judge can decide to pardon a player that they think is innocent,
  to condemn a player that they think is guilty, or vice versa.
- If the nominee is pardoned, then they are not executed today, and none
  of the votes for them count. If the nominee is condemned, then they
  are executed immediately, regardless of how many votes they received,
  and regardless of whether another player was about to die by
  execution. Then the day ends, because there can normally only be one
  execution per day.
- The Judge may use their ability during or after the votes are tallied.
  However, once a new player has been nominated, then the Judge may only
  use their ability on this new nominee. The Judge may only use their
  ability once, and only if a different player made a nomination.

## How To Run

At any time during a nomination for execution—from the moment that the
nomination is declared to the moment before a new player is nominated
for execution—the Judge can declare that this execution succeeds or
fails. If the Judge declares that it succeeds, the nominated player is
executed and you may proceed to the night phase (_as there may only be
one execution per day_). If the Judge declares that it fails, the
nominated player is no longer about to die and they are treated as
receiving zero votes for execution, and the nomination process
continues. **The Judge loses their ability**—put the Judge’s **NO
ABILITY** reminder token by the Judge token.
