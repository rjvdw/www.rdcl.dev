  Each day, you may choose up to 3 sets of 2 players to swap seats.
  Players may not leave their seats to talk in private.
---

The Matron chooses which players sit where.

- The Matron may swap two players’ seating positions, up to three times
  per day. The new seating order is permanent, unless changed again by
  the Matron.
- The same player may be moved multiple times.
- Some players may find moving difficult due to a physical disability or
  impediment. In these cases, they are immune to the Matron’s ability
  and can stay put.
- With the Matron in play, players may not talk privately except with
  their immediate neighbors while sitting down. Players may not leave
  their seat to whisper something to any player, and may not even talk
  about the game to each other when going to the bathroom, and so on.
  Players should self-police this.
- If the Matron swaps just one or two sets of players, they may not swap
  another set of players later that day.

## How To Run

Players who leave their seats cannot talk about the game to other
players until they return.

Each day, the Matron may choose two players and declare that they swap
seating positions. Ask them to do so. Swap their character tokens and
any reminders they have in the Grimoire. The Matron may do this up to
three times, but all swaps happen one after the other.
