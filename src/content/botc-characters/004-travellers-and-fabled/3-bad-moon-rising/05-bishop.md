  Only the Storyteller can nominate. At least 1 opposing player must be
  nominated each day.
---

The Bishop prevents players from nominating at all. Instead, the
Storyteller does all nominating.

- The Storyteller makes nominations during the nomination process
  instead of the players, and the Storyteller may nominate as few or as
  many players as they wish. To make things fair, they must nominate at
  least one player whose alignment is opposite the Bishop’s alignment
  each day.
- The Bishop does not alter who can and cannot vote. Each player may do
  so normally.
- Since Travellers are exiled, not executed, any player may call for the
  Bishop or another Traveller to be exiled.

## How To Run

Each dawn, mark the good Bishop with their **NOMINATE EVIL** reminder,
or mark the evil Bishop with their **NOMINATE GOOD** reminder.

During the nomination process for execution, the players cannot make
nominations, but you can. (_Voting happens as normal._) When you
nominate a player whose alignment is opposite the alignment of the
Bishop, remove the Bishop’s reminder. You cannot end the nomination
process if the Bishop is marked with their reminder.
