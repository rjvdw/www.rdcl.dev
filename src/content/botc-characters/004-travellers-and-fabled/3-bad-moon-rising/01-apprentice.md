The Apprentice has either a Townsfolk or a Minion ability.

- A good Apprentice gains a Townsfolk ability. An evil Apprentice gains
  a Minion ability. They have this ability until they die.
- The Apprentice learns their ability on their first night, and they may
  act that night if the character whose ability they gain would do so.
- Only abilities listed on the character sheet may be gained.
- If the Apprentice gains an ability that normally only functions on the
  first night of the game, such as the Grandmother’s, it functions on
  the Apprentice’s first night instead.
- The Apprentice does not literally become the character whose ability
  they gain. They are the Apprentice, a Traveller, so they may be exiled
  but not executed, and they do not count toward the number of alive
  players to see if evil wins due to just two players being alive. Also,
  other characters’ abilities that detect characters would detect the
  Apprentice as the Apprentice.

## How To Run

During the first night after the Apprentice enters play, wake the
Apprentice. Show them the **YOU ARE** info token, then a Townsfolk or
Minion token. In the Grimoire, replace the Apprentice token with that
character token, and mark them with the **IS THE APPRENTICE** reminder.
That player remains the Apprentice but gains the ability of their
character token.
