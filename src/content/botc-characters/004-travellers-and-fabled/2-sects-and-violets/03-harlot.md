The Harlot learns the character of whoever agrees to reveal it, but at
great risk for them both.

- Each night, the Harlot chooses a player. That player has a decision to
  make: do they reveal their character to the Harlot? If they do, the
  Storyteller may decide that both this player and the Harlot die
  tonight.
- The Harlot only learns the character of the chosen player, not that
  player’s alignment.
- The Harlot may discuss during the day which character they would like
  to pick at night, and other players may offer to be picked, but they
  may go back on their word and choose differently when night comes.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Harlot. The Harlot points at any player. Put the
Harlot to sleep. Wake the chosen player, show them the **THIS CHARACTER
SELECTED YOU** info token, then the Harlot token. That player either
nods their head yes or shakes their head no. Put that player to sleep.

If they shook their head no, then nothing happens. Continue with the
night phase.

If they nodded their head yes, wake the Harlot and show them the chosen
player’s character token. Put the Harlot to sleep. You may decide that
both players **die**—mark them with **DEAD** reminders.
