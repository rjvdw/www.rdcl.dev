name: Barista

type: Traveller
game: Sects & Violets
tagLine:
  Each night, until dusk, 1) a player becomes sober, healthy & gets true
  info, or 2) their ability works twice. They learn which.
description: |
  The Barista either makes people sober & healthy, or allows them to act
  twice as much as normal.

  - The Storyteller chooses which player the Barista affects each night,
    and which one of the two Barista abilities is in effect. The Barista
    does not know who or what the Storyteller chooses, but the affected
    player does.
  - If the affected player is acting twice, then they do so at the
    normal time. If they would normally wake at night, they act, go to
    sleep, then wake to act again. If they have already used a “once per
    game” ability, they may use that ability again. If they have a “once
    per game” ability but have not used it yet, they may use it twice
    before dusk.
  - If the Barista makes a player sober and healthy, their drunkenness
    and poisoning, if any, is removed, and they may not become drunk or
    poisoned until dusk. This player must get true information, even if
    a Vortox is in play.
howToRun: |
  Each night, remove previous reminders then put the Barista’s **SOBER
  AND HEALTHY** reminder or their **ACTS TWICE** reminder by any
  character token. Wake that character’s player and show them the **THIS
  CHARACTER SELECTED YOU** info token, the Barista token, then one
  finger (*to show they are sober and healthy*) or two fingers (*to show
  they act twice*). Put that player to sleep.

  A player marked **SOBER AND HEALTHY** is sober and healthy (even if
  they’re also marked **DRUNK** or **POISONED**) and always gets true
  information (*even if an ability would make them drunk or poisoned*).

  A player marked **ACTS TWICE** acts twice at the appropriate time.
  (*If the ability is optional, they may use it twice. If it is
  mandatory, they must use it twice.*) Use the Barista’s **?** reminders
  if needed, to substitute for the character’s own reminders.
