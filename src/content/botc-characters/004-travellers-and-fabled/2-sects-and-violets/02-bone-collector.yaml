type: Traveller
game: Sects & Violets
tagLine: >-
  Once per game, at night, choose a dead player: they regain their
  ability until dusk.
description: |
  The Bone Collector temporarily gives dead players their ability back.

  - The Bone Collector must choose a dead player. The chosen player
    remains dead, but they get their ability to use. If their ability
    was a “you start knowing” or a “once per game” ability—such as the
    Virgin, Slayer, Clockmaker, Seamstress, or Juggler—they may use it
    again, even if it was already used, until dusk falls.
  - When the Bone Collector chooses a player, that player does not learn
    they were selected by the Bone Collector, although they find out
    soon enough when they are woken to use their ability.
  - If the Bone Collector dies, that player no longer has the ability
    they regained due to the Bone Collector.
howToRun: |
  Each night, wake the Bone Collector. They either shake their head no
  or point at any dead player. Put the Bone Collector to sleep.

  If they pointed at a dead player, **the chosen player regains their
  ability**—mark their character token with the Bone Collector’s **HAS
  ABILITY** reminder. (*They may need to be woken tonight to use their
  ability.*) **The Bone Collector loses their ability**—mark them with
  their **NO ABILITY** reminder. The next dusk, **the chosen player
  loses their ability**—remove the **HAS ABILITY** reminder.
