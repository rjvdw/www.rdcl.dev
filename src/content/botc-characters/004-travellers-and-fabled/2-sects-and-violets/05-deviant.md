  If you were funny today, you cannot die by exile.

The Deviant can avoid being Exiled - as long as the Deviant player has
been amusing today.

- The Deviant can amuse the group in any way they choose. Generally,
  verbal means such as jokes, funny stories, or witty remarks will
  suffice.
- The Storyteller is the judge of whether the Deviant was funny or not.

## How To Run

If the Deviant would be exiled, you may declare that the Deviant remains
alive.
