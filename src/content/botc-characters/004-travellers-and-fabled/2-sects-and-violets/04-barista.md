The Barista either makes people sober & healthy, or allows them to act
twice as much as normal.

- The Storyteller chooses which player the Barista affects each night,
  and which one of the two Barista abilities is in effect. The Barista
  does not know who or what the Storyteller chooses, but the affected
  player does.
- If the affected player is acting twice, then they do so at the normal
  time. If they would normally wake at night, they act, go to sleep,
  then wake to act again. If they have already used a “once per game”
  ability, they may use that ability again. If they have a “once per
  game” ability but have not used it yet, they may use it twice before
  dusk.
- If the Barista makes a player sober and healthy, their drunkenness and
  poisoning, if any, is removed, and they may not become drunk or
  poisoned until dusk. This player must get true information, even if a
  Vortox is in play.

## How To Run

Each night, remove previous reminders then put the Barista’s **SOBER AND
HEALTHY** reminder or their **ACTS TWICE** reminder by any character
token. Wake that character’s player and show them the **THIS CHARACTER
SELECTED YOU** info token, the Barista token, then one finger (_to show
they are sober and healthy_) or two fingers (_to show they act twice_).
Put that player to sleep.

A player marked **SOBER AND HEALTHY** is sober and healthy (even if
they’re also marked **DRUNK** or **POISONED**) and always gets true
information (_even if an ability would make them drunk or poisoned_).

A player marked **ACTS TWICE** acts twice at the appropriate time. (_If
the ability is optional, they may use it twice. If it is mandatory, they
must use it twice._) Use the Barista’s **?** reminders if needed, to
substitute for the character’s own reminders.
