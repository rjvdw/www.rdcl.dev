      The Bone Collector either shakes their head no or points at any
      dead player. If they pointed at any dead player, put the Bone
      Collector's 'Has Ability' reminder by the chosen player's
      character token. (They may need to be woken tonight to use it.)

The Bone Collector temporarily gives dead players their ability back.

- The Bone Collector must choose a dead player. The chosen player
  remains dead, but they get their ability to use. If their ability was
  a “you start knowing” or a “once per game” ability—such as the Virgin,
  Slayer, Clockmaker, Seamstress, or Juggler—they may use it again, even
  if it was already used, until dusk falls.
- When the Bone Collector chooses a player, that player does not learn
  they were selected by the Bone Collector, although they find out soon
  enough when they are woken to use their ability.
- If the Bone Collector dies, that player no longer has the ability they
  regained due to the Bone Collector.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Bone Collector. They either shake their head no or
point at any dead player. Put the Bone Collector to sleep.

If they pointed at a dead player, **the chosen player regains their
ability**—mark their character token with the Bone Collector’s **HAS
ABILITY** reminder. (_They may need to be woken tonight to use their
ability._) **The Bone Collector loses their ability**—mark them with
their **NO ABILITY** reminder. The next dusk, **the chosen player loses
their ability**—remove the **HAS ABILITY** reminder.
