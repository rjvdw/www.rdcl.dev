  Each day, after the 1st execution, you may nominate again.
---

The Butcher allows a second execution to occur per day.

- After the first executed player has died, the Butcher may nominate a
  second player for execution. The Butcher may nominate a player that
  has already been nominated today, and the Butcher may make a
  nomination even if the Butcher already made a nomination earlier
  today.
- If a player is executed, even if they do not die, then the Butcher may
  use their ability. The players may choose to vote or not to vote, so
  there is no guarantee that this extra nomination will cause an
  execution—it still needs to get enough votes—but this second
  nomination does not need to exceed the vote tally of the previous
  nominations.
- If no execution occurs today, then the Butcher may not use their
  ability at all today.

## How To Run

Each day, immediately after a player is executed, the Butcher may
nominate a player for execution. (_Remind them if needed._) To succeed,
this nomination must tally votes of at least half the alive players, as
normal, but does not have to exceed the votes of the execution that
prompted the Butcher ability. If this second execution succeeds, it does
not allow the Butcher to nominate a third player.
