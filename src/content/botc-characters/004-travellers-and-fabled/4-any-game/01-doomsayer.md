Use the Doomsayer to make large games take less time.

- The Doomsayer allows players to sacrifice their allies in order to
  gain information, which shortens the game.
- Only alive players may use the Doomsayer ability, and each may do so
  only once per game. It is their responsibility to remember to not use
  it again.
- If a player says something like “I use the Doomsayer ability,” then
  the Storyteller chooses which player to kill, but they must kill an
  alive player of the same alignment as the player who used the
  Doomsayer ability. So, if a good player uses the ability, then a good
  player dies. If an evil player uses the ability, then an evil player
  dies.
- Once three players are left alive, the Doomsayer ability may no longer
  be used.

## How To Run

At any time, declare that the Doomsayer is in play. Add the Doomsayer
token to the Grimoire.

At any time during the day, if four or more players are alive, a player
can declare that they wish to use the Doomsayer ability. When this
happens, choose one player of the same alignment. The chosen player
dies.
