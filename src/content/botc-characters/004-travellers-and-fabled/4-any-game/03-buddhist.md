Use the Buddhist to help new players have fun when there are one or two
veterans in a group of new players.

- When experienced players find themselves in a game full of beginners,
  the veterans will often dominate the game due to their enthusiasm and
  knowledge.
- Players affected by the Buddhist cannot talk at all for the first two
  minutes of each day. They may not whisper in private, and may not talk
  to each other. They simply listen.
- This is not a punishment for being talkative. Being talkative is
  great! Blood on the Clocktower is a talking game, and the more, the
  merrier. That said, forcing the veterans to stay silent temporarily
  each day allows the new players to find their own voices, to come up
  with their own theories, and to take action on their own. It is about
  fun for everybody.
- It is common for a player to say “I am a Buddhist” or for the
  Storyteller to say to them “You are a Buddhist.” This doesn’t mean
  that their character is the Buddhist. It is a pleasant shorthand for
  saying “You are affected by the Buddhist ability.” This is similar to
  saying “You are a Revolutionary.”

## How To Run

At the start of the game, declare that the Buddhist is in play. Add the
Buddhist token to the Grimoire. Declare which players are Buddhists,
with their consent. Those players must stay silent for the first two
minutes of each day.

Remove the Buddhist at any time, declaring when you do so.
