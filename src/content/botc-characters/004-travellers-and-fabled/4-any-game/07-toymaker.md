Use the Toymaker to make small games take more time.

- If you created a character list using the Teensyville option in the
  Script Tool, then you may want to use the Toymaker. Games set in
  Teensyville have only six Townsfolk, two Outsiders, two Minions, and
  two Demons on the list, and they specifically cater to five or six
  players.
- With the Toymaker in play, the Demon learns three not-in-play
  characters at the start of the game, and the Minion(s) and Demon learn
  who each other are. Once per game, the Demon must voluntarily choose
  to attack nobody tonight. If the Demon is about wake to attack a
  player and this would end the game, but the Demon has not yet chosen
  to attack nobody, then the Storyteller does not wake the Demon—they
  are forced to attack nobody tonight.
- You may use the Toymaker in games of Trouble Brewing with five or six
  players, but it is not necessary.

## How To Run

At the start of the game, declare that the Toymaker is in play. Add the
Toymaker token to the Grimoire, and mark the Demon with the Toymaker’s
**FINAL NIGHT: NO ATTACK** reminder.

On the first night, resolve the "Minion info" and "Demon info” steps on
the night sheet even though there are fewer than seven players.

Each night the Demon wakes, they may choose not to attack by shaking
their head no. If they choose not to attack, remove the **FINAL NIGHT:
NO ATTACK** reminder.

During any night, if the Demon would wake and their attack could end the
game, but the Demon is marked **FINAL NIGHT: NO ATTACK**, the Demon does
not wake or act tonight.
