type: Fabled
game: Any Game
tagLine: >-
  The Demon may choose not to attack & must do this at least once per
  game. Evil players get normal starting info.

  Use the Toymaker to make small games take more time.

  - If you created a character list using the Teensyville option in the
    Script Tool, then you may want to use the Toymaker. Games set in
    Teensyville have only six Townsfolk, two Outsiders, two Minions, and
    two Demons on the list, and they specifically cater to five or six
    players.
  - With the Toymaker in play, the Demon learns three not-in-play
    characters at the start of the game, and the Minion(s) and Demon
    learn who each other are. Once per game, the Demon must voluntarily
    choose to attack nobody tonight. If the Demon is about wake to
    attack a player and this would end the game, but the Demon has not
    yet chosen to attack nobody, then the Storyteller does not wake the
    Demon—they are forced to attack nobody tonight.
  - You may use the Toymaker in games of Trouble Brewing with five or
    six players, but it is not necessary.
howToRun: |
  At the start of the game, declare that the Toymaker is in play. Add
  the Toymaker token to the Grimoire, and mark the Demon with the
  Toymaker’s **FINAL NIGHT: NO ATTACK** reminder.

  On the first night, resolve the "Minion info" and "Demon info” steps
  on the night sheet even though there are fewer than seven players.

  Each night the Demon wakes, they may choose not to attack by shaking
  their head no. If they choose not to attack, remove the **FINAL NIGHT:
  NO ATTACK** reminder.

  During any night, if the Demon would wake and their attack could end
  the game, but the Demon is marked **FINAL NIGHT: NO ATTACK**, the
  Demon does not wake or act tonight.

      If it is a night when a Demon attack could end the game, and the
      Demon is marked “Final night: No Attack,” then the Demon does not
      act tonight. (Do not wake them.)
