  2 neighboring players are known to be the same alignment. Once per
  game, 1 of them registers falsely.

Use the Revolutionary to help disadvantaged players participate.

- If a player has an intellectual disability, is unable to understand
  the rules of the game, is blind or deaf, or is unable to communicate
  or participate as normal, they may still play by teaming up with a
  player that they trust.
- These two players are the same alignment and sit next to each other so
  they can whisper or signal to each other throughout the game. The
  experienced player can help the disadvantaged player in whatever way
  is needed, talking on their behalf or suggesting what to do.
- The Revolutionary is also useful for couples or good friends who wish
  to play, but are uncomfortable with lying to or mistrusting each
  other, even in a game.
- Once per game, the Storyteller can make either player register as a
  different character, alignment, or both.
- The Storyteller may wake both players at night, instead of just the
  player due to wake, if that helps understanding.
- If an ability would change a Revolutionary’s alignment, this ability
  has no effect or it changes both Revolutionaries’ alignment,
  Storyteller’s choice.

## How To Run

When setting up the game, before giving the bag to the players, declare
that the Revolutionary is in play and which two neighboring players are
Revolutionaries. Add the Revolutionary token to the Grimoire. Mark the
Revolutionaries with the **REGISTER FALSELY?** reminder between their
character tokens.

Give the bag to one Revolutionary. They draw a token. Look at their
token, choose a token of the same alignment from the bag, and give it to
the other Revolutionary. Then, give the bag to the non-Revolutionary
players to draw from.

Once per game, you can make one player marked **REGISTER FALSELY?**
register as a different character and alignment, then remove the
**REGISTER FALSELY?** reminder.
