name: Fiddler
slug: fiddler
source: https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Fiddler
type: Fabled
game: Any Game
tagLine: >-
  Once per game, the Demon secretly chooses an opposing player: all
  players choose which of these 2 players win.
---

Use the Fiddler to decide a winner if the game must end due to time
constraints or a stalemate.

- Sometimes there won’t be enough time to finish a game. Maybe the venue
  you are playing at needs to close. Maybe some players need to leave
  unexpectedly and the game cannot continue without them. Maybe the
  Townsfolk refuse to execute and the Demon refuses to kill.
- The Storyteller can add and activate the Fiddler at any time. To do
  so, all players close their eyes while the Demon chooses a good player
  to challenge to a fiddle contest. Then, after a minute or two, all
  players will raise their hands to vote on which of these two players
  wins. The game ends, and the winning player’s entire team wins too.
- Like an exile, this group decision on who wins the game is not
  affected by abilities, and the dead may vote normally. The Thief
  cannot steal votes, the Voudon has no effect, and so on.
- Players cannot use their abilities once the Fiddler has been
  activated. The Slayer cannot choose to slay a player, the Artist
  cannot ask their question, and so on.
- If this fiddle contest is a tie, evil wins.

## How To Run

At any time, if you expect to run out of time, declare that the Fiddler
is in play and declare the time when the game will end. Add the Fiddler
token to the Grimoire.

When the game needs to end, declare that you are using the Fiddler
ability. Put all players to sleep. Wake the Demon. They point at any
good player. (_If the Demon is good, they must choose an evil player
instead._) Wake all players and declare that the Demon player and the
chosen player are in a fiddle contest. (Do not say what their characters
are.) After a minute or two, run a “vote” for each player in the fiddle
contest. (This is not an execution vote.) All players may vote. The
player with the most votes wins, their team wins, and the game ends. On
a tie, the evil team wins.
