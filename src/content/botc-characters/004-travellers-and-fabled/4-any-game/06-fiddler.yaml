name: Fiddler
source: https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Fiddler
type: Fabled
game: Any Game
tagLine: >-
  Once per game, the Demon secretly chooses an opposing player: all
  players choose which of these 2 players win.
description: |
  Use the Fiddler to decide a winner if the game must end due to time
  constraints or a stalemate.

  - Sometimes there won’t be enough time to finish a game. Maybe the
    venue you are playing at needs to close. Maybe some players need to
    leave unexpectedly and the game cannot continue without them. Maybe
    the Townsfolk refuse to execute and the Demon refuses to kill.
  - The Storyteller can add and activate the Fiddler at any time. To do
    so, all players close their eyes while the Demon chooses a good
    player to challenge to a fiddle contest. Then, after a minute or
    two, all players will raise their hands to vote on which of these
    two players wins. The game ends, and the winning player’s entire
    team wins too.
  - Like an exile, this group decision on who wins the game is not
    affected by abilities, and the dead may vote normally. The Thief
    cannot steal votes, the Voudon has no effect, and so on.
  - Players cannot use their abilities once the Fiddler has been
    activated. The Slayer cannot choose to slay a player, the Artist
    cannot ask their question, and so on.
  - If this fiddle contest is a tie, evil wins.
howToRun: |
  At any time, if you expect to run out of time, declare that the
  Fiddler is in play and declare the time when the game will end. Add
  the Fiddler token to the Grimoire.

  When the game needs to end, declare that you are using the Fiddler
  ability. Put all players to sleep. Wake the Demon. They point at any
  good player. (*If the Demon is good, they must choose an evil player
  instead.*) Wake all players and declare that the Demon player and the
  chosen player are in a fiddle contest. (Do not say what their
  characters are.) After a minute or two, run a “vote” for each player
  in the fiddle contest. (This is not an execution vote.) All players
  may vote. The player with the most votes wins, their team wins, and
  the game ends. On a tie, the evil team wins.
