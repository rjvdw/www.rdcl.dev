game: Any Game
tagLine: For the first 2 minutes of each day, veteran players may not talk.
description: |
  Use the Buddhist to help new players have fun when there are one or
  two veterans in a group of new players.

  - When experienced players find themselves in a game full of
    beginners, the veterans will often dominate the game due to their
    enthusiasm and knowledge.
  - Players affected by the Buddhist cannot talk at all for the first
    two minutes of each day. They may not whisper in private, and may
    not talk to each other. They simply listen.
  - This is not a punishment for being talkative. Being talkative is
    great! Blood on the Clocktower is a talking game, and the more, the
    merrier. That said, forcing the veterans to stay silent temporarily
    each day allows the new players to find their own voices, to come up
    with their own theories, and to take action on their own. It is
    about fun for everybody.
  - It is common for a player to say “I am a Buddhist” or for the
    Storyteller to say to them “You are a Buddhist.” This doesn’t mean
    that their character is the Buddhist. It is a pleasant shorthand for
    saying “You are affected by the Buddhist ability.” This is similar
    to saying “You are a Revolutionary.”
howToRun: |
  At the start of the game, declare that the Buddhist is in play. Add
  the Buddhist token to the Grimoire. Declare which players are
  Buddhists, with their consent. Those players must stay silent for the
  first two minutes of each day.

  Remove the Buddhist at any time, declaring when you do so.
