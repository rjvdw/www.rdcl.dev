  Something bad might happen to whoever talks when the Storyteller has
  asked for silence.

Use the Hell’s Librarian to allow a softly-spoken Storyteller to be
heard when needed.

- As the Storyteller, you’ll find the Hell’s Librarian useful when it is
  difficult to get the group’s attention. Maybe you need to explain a
  game rule? Or get attention for a crucial final-day vote? It can also
  be used to prevent players from talking about their characters before
  the game begins or from narrating what they are doing at night.
  Players instinctively stay quieter during the pre-game period and at
  night, so you may never need it.
- It is best to give the players fair warning before you bring the
  hammer down. Like the Angel, the threat of a mysterious penalty is
  more important than the actual penalty. The purpose of this character
  is to make games run smoothly, not to punish minor infringements.

## How To Run

At any time, declare that the Hell’s Librarian is in play. Add the
Hell’s Librarian token and their **SOMETHING BAD** reminder to the
Grimoire.

At any time, you can ask the group for silence for a particular period
of time. Remind them that the Hell’s Librarian is in play if needed. If
a player talks or otherwise interrupts and makes your job difficult
during that time, you can let them know that something bad happens to
them. You may need to mark their character token with the **SOMETHING
BAD** reminder, to remind you that they are now poisoned, or mad, or
can’t vote today, or simply as a reminder to decide on what to do later.
