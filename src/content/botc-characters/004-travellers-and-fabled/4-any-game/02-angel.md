  Something bad might happen to whoever is most responsible for the
  death of a new player.
---

Use the Angel to help new players have fun when there are one or two new
players in a group of veterans.

- Being the only new player in a group can be overwhelming. Being
  protected by the Angel encourages all players to keep new players
  alive for as long as possible, which means new players have more fun
  and contribute to the game more.
- All players know who is protected by the Angel, but not their
  alignment or character. Whoever is the single player most responsible
  for killing a protected player suffers some consequence. For example,
  if the Demon kills a protected player, the Demon suffers a penalty. If
  a protected player is executed, the player who suffers a penalty will
  probably be the one who nominated the protected player.

## How To Run

At the start of the game, declare that the Angel is in play. Declare
which player or players it is protecting, with their consent. Add the
Angel token and their reminders to the Grimoire, and mark each protected
player with a **PROTECTED** reminder.

If a player marked **PROTECTED** dies, something bad happens to the
player responsible for the death. You may need to mark their character
token with the **SOMETHING BAD** reminder, to remind you that they are
now poisoned, or mad, or canâ€™t vote today, or simply as a reminder to
decide on what to do later.

Remove the Angel at any time, declaring when you do so.
