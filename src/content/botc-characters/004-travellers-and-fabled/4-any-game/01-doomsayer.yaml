  Use the Doomsayer to make large games take less time.

  - The Doomsayer allows players to sacrifice their allies in order to
    gain information, which shortens the game.
  - Only alive players may use the Doomsayer ability, and each may do
    so only once per game. It is their responsibility to remember to not
    use it again.
  - If a player says something like “I use the Doomsayer ability,” then
    the Storyteller chooses which player to kill, but they must kill an
    alive player of the same alignment as the player who used the
    Doomsayer ability. So, if a good player uses the ability, then a
    good player dies. If an evil player uses the ability, then an evil
    player dies.
  - Once three players are left alive, the Doomsayer ability may no
    longer be used.
howToRun: |
  At any time, declare that the Doomsayer is in play. Add the Doomsayer
  token to the Grimoire.

  At any time during the day, if four or more players are alive, a
  player can declare that they wish to use the Doomsayer ability. When
  this happens, choose one player of the same alignment. The chosen
  player dies.
