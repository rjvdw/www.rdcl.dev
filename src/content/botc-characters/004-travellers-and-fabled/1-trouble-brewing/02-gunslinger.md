The Gunslinger kills players who vote.

- Each day, after the first vote for execution has been tallied, the
  Gunslinger may publicly choose a player that just voted to die
  immediately. The Gunslinger does not have to kill a player—it is
  entirely up to them. Whether they use their ability or not, the
  Gunslinger cannot kill any further players that day.
- It is the Gunslinger’s responsibility to speak up and let the
  Storyteller know that they wish to use their ability.
- Since exiles are not affected by character abilities in any way, the
  Gunslinger cannot use their ability to kill a player that supports an
  exile.

## How To Run

Each day, immediately after the first vote for execution is tallied, the
Gunslinger can declare that they wish to use their ability. If so, the
Gunslinger points at any player who voted for this execution. The chosen
player **dies**.
