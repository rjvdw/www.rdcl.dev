  Each day, after the 1st vote has been tallied, you may choose a player
  that voted: they die.
description: |
  The Gunslinger kills players who vote.

  - Each day, after the first vote for execution has been tallied, the
    Gunslinger may publicly choose a player that just voted to die
    immediately. The Gunslinger does not have to kill a player—it is
    entirely up to them. Whether they use their ability or not, the
    Gunslinger cannot kill any further players that day.
  - It is the Gunslinger’s responsibility to speak up and let the
    Storyteller know that they wish to use their ability.
  - Since exiles are not affected by character abilities in any way, the
    Gunslinger cannot use their ability to kill a player that supports
    an exile.

  Each day, immediately after the first vote for execution is tallied,
  the Gunslinger can declare that they wish to use their ability. If so,
  the Gunslinger points at any player who voted for this execution. The
  chosen player **dies**.
