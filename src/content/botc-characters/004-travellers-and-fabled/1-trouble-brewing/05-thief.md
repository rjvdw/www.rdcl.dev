The Thief steals votes from a player, making their vote count
negatively.

- When a player chosen by the Thief votes, the vote tally goes down by
  one instead of up by one. This happens every time that player votes
  that day.
- The player with the negative vote changes back to having a positive
  vote immediately if the Thief dies, including if the Thief is exiled,
  because the Thief loses their ability.
- Exiles are never affected by abilities, so the player with the
  negative vote can support exiles unaffected by the Thief’s ability.
- Since the Storyteller counts the number of votes out loud as they move
  their hand around the circle, all players will know which player the
  Thief chose.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Thief. They point at any player. Mark the chosen
player with the Thief’s **NEGATIVE VOTE** reminder. Put the Thief to
sleep.

Each time you tally the vote of a player marked **NEGATIVE VOTE**, count
it as subtracting one vote instead of adding one vote. (_Count this out
loud, as normal._)
