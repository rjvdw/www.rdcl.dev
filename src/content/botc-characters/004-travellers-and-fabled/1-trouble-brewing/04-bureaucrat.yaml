  Each night, choose a player (not yourself): their vote counts as 3
  votes tomorrow.
description: |
  The Bureaucrat gives extra votes to a player of their choice.

  - When a player chosen by the Bureaucrat votes, that vote counts as
    three votes. This happens every time that player votes that day.
  - The player with the triple vote loses it immediately if the
    Bureaucrat dies, including if the Bureaucrat is exiled, because the
    Bureaucrat loses their ability.
  - Exiles are never affected by abilities, so the player with the
    triple vote can only support exiles once, not three times.
  - Since the Storyteller counts the number of votes out loud as they
    move their hand around the circle, all players will know which
    player the Bureaucrat chose.
howToRun: |
  Each night, wake the Bureaucrat. They point at any player. Mark the
  chosen player with the Bureaucratâ€™s **3 VOTES** reminder. Put the
  Bureaucrat to sleep.

  Each time you tally the vote of a player marked **3 VOTES**, count it
  as three votes instead of one. (*Count this out loud, as normal.*)
