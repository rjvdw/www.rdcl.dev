  If a player of your alignment is executed, you might be executed
  instead.
---

The Scapegoat is executed instead of an ally.

- If the Scapegoat is evil, they might die instead of an evil player
  dying. If the Scapegoat is good, they might die instead of a good
  player dying. When exactly this happens is up to the Storyteller. This
  can only happen due to an execution, not death by other means such as
  a Demon or Slayer.
- The Scapegoat being killed still counts as an execution, so no more
  nominations occur today.
- As always, players do not learn the alignment of the Scapegoat when
  they die.

## How To Run

If a player of the same alignment as the Scapegoat would be executed,
you may choose that the Scapegoat is executed instead. The Scapegoat
**dies**.
