The Bureaucrat gives extra votes to a player of their choice.

- When a player chosen by the Bureaucrat votes, that vote counts as
  three votes. This happens every time that player votes that day.
- The player with the triple vote loses it immediately if the Bureaucrat
  dies, including if the Bureaucrat is exiled, because the Bureaucrat
  loses their ability.
- Exiles are never affected by abilities, so the player with the triple
  vote can only support exiles once, not three times.
- Since the Storyteller counts the number of votes out loud as they move
  their hand around the circle, all players will know which player the
  Bureaucrat chose.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Bureaucrat. They point at any player. Mark the
chosen player with the Bureaucrat’s **3 VOTES** reminder. Put the
Bureaucrat to sleep.

Each time you tally the vote of a player marked **3 VOTES**, count it as
three votes instead of one. (_Count this out loud, as normal._)
