  Each night, choose a player: if they nominate tomorrow, they die. If
  just 3 players live, you lose this ability.
description: |
  The Witch curses players, so that they die if they nominate.

  - Each night, the Witch chooses a player to curse. That player dies if
    they nominate any player on the next day, although their nomination
    still counts.
  - The Witch’s curse lasts only for one day, but the Witch may curse
    the same player again and again each night.
  - As soon as just three players are left alive, the Witch’s curse is
    immediately removed, and the Witch acts no more.
howToRun: |
  Each night, wake the Witch. They point at any player. Put the Witch to
  sleep. Mark the chosen player with the **CURSED** reminder.

  The next day, if the player marked **CURSED** makes a nomination,
  immediately declare that they die. (Nominations continue as normal.)
