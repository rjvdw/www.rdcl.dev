The Witch curses players, so that they die if they nominate.

- Each night, the Witch chooses a player to curse. That player dies if
  they nominate any player on the next day, although their nomination
  still counts.
- The Witch’s curse lasts only for one day, but the Witch may curse the
  same player again and again each night.
- As soon as just three players are left alive, the Witch’s curse is
  immediately removed, and the Witch acts no more.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Witch. They point at any player. Put the Witch to
sleep. Mark the chosen player with the **CURSED** reminder.

The next day, if the player marked **CURSED** makes a nomination,
immediately declare that they die. (Nominations continue as normal.)
