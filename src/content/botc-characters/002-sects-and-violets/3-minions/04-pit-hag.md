      The Pit-Hag points to a player and a character on the sheet. If
      this character is not in play, wake that player and show them the
      'You are' card and the relevant character token. If the character
      is in play, nothing happens.

The Pit-Hag changes players into different characters.

- Each night, the Pit-Hag chooses a player and a character to turn that
  player into.
- They can’t create duplicate characters. If the character is already in
  play, nothing happens.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Pit-Hag. They point at any player
and any character icon on their character sheet. Put the Pit-Hag to
sleep.

If the chosen character is in play, nothing happens.

If the chosen character is not in play, wake the chosen player. Show
them the **YOU ARE** info token, then their new character token, then
put them to sleep. Replace their old character token with the new
character token. (_You may need to turn character tokens upside-down to
remind you that a player’s alignment is opposite to the color of the
token. You may need to remind the player that their alignment is
unchanged, by giving a thumbs-up or thumbs-down._)

If a Demon is created, you may choose any players to kill or to protect
throughout the night to balance the game. Additional deaths are
considered attacks from the Pit-Hag.
