The Cerenovus encourages players to pretend to be different characters
than they actually are.

- The Cerenovus chooses Townsfolk or Outsiders that players are mad
  about being. They must try to convince the group that they actually
  are this character tomorrow, or else die.
- Simply hinting is not enough to avoid death. The player must make a
  decent effort to convince the group. Mad players are never literally
  forced to say things they don’t want to—but if the Storyteller doesn’t
  hear them make an effort, they pay the price.
- Mad evil players might be executed this way, but “might” means you can
  choose not to, to prevent evil from winning by this strategy.
- Like the Mutant, an execution penalty counts as the one execution
  allowed per day.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Cerenovus. They point at any player and at any
Townsfolk or Outsider icon on their character sheet. Put the Cerenovus
to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the **MAD** reminder. Wake this
player, show them the **THIS CHARACTER SELECTED YOU** info token, then
the Cerenovus token, then the character token of the character they are
mad about being. Put that player to sleep.

During the next day or night, if you feel that the mad player has not
done their best to convince the group they are this character, you can
decide to execute them. Declare this to the group. They die. If you
execute them during the day before the normal execution happens, go to
the night phase. (_There is a maximum of one execution per day._)
