The Evil Twin mirrors a good character, so that the players don't know
which twin is good and which twin is evil.

- The Evil Twin is paired with a good player, chosen by the Storyteller,
  called the Good Twin.
- On the first night, the Evil Twin and Good Twin both wake, make eye
  contact, and learn each other’s character.
- If the Good Twin is executed, evil wins. If the Evil Twin is executed,
  the game continues. A dead Evil Twin has no ability, so evil doesn’t
  win if the Good Twin is later executed.
- Good cannot win while both twins are alive. Even if the Demon is
  killed, the game continues. Good will need to kill the Evil Twin as
  well as the Demon to win.
- If a good player is turned into an Evil Twin, they are still a good
  player, with an evil player becoming their twin. It doesn’t matter
  which twin is which character, what matters is their alignment—the
  good team can execute the evil player safely, but if they execute the
  good player, evil wins.
- If both Twins are the same alignment, the Storyteller chooses a new
  Twin.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, choose a Good Twin by marking any good
character with the **TWIN** reminder. During the first night, wake both
Twins. Let them make eye contact. Point at the Evil Twin, then show the
Evil Twin token to the Good Twin. Point at the Good Twin, then show the
Good Twin’s character token to the Evil Twin. Put them both to sleep.

While both Twins are alive, the good team cannot win. If a good-aligned
Twin is executed, the evil team wins.
