The Philosopher has no ability until they decide which character they
want to emulate.

- They can do this once per game. When they do so, they gain that
  character’s ability. They do not become that character.
- They may want to wait a while to choose. If the Philosopher chooses a
  character that is already in play, the player of that character
  becomes drunk. If the Philosopher then dies or becomes drunk or
  poisoned, the player they are making drunk becomes sober again.
- If the Philosopher chose a character that was not in play at the time
  but is in play now, that character is drunk.
- If the Philosopher gains an ability that works at night, they wake
  when that character would wake. If this ability is used on the first
  night only, they use it tonight.
- If the Philosopher regains their ability via the Bone Collector, or
  uses their ability twice via the Barista, the Philosopher may choose a
  new ability, or the same ability as before.
- If the Philosopher’s ability works while dead, such as the Klutz’s, it
  works if the Philosopher is dead.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Philosopher. They either shake their head no or
point at any Townsfolk icon or any Outsider icon on their character
sheet. Put the Philosopher to sleep.

If they pointed to an icon of a character not in play, swap the
Philosopher token with the chosen character token and mark them with the
**IS THE PHILOSOPHER** reminder.

If they pointed to an icon of a character in play, the player of the
chosen character becomes **drunk** - mark them with the **DRUNK**
reminder. (_You can now use the duplicated character’s reminders for the
Philosopher_). If the Philosopher dies, the player made drunk by the
Philosopher becomes **sober** - remove the **DRUNK** reminder.
