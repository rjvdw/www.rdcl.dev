  The Oracle knows how many dead players are evil.

  - Because the Oracle acts after the Demon attacks each night, the
    Oracleâ€™s info refers to the players that are dead when dawn breaks
    and all players open their eyes.
  - The Oracle detects dead Minions and Demons, but also any other
    players that are evil, such as evil Travellers, or Townsfolk or
    Outsiders that have been turned evil.
  - When counting the number of dead players, remember to count
    Townsfolk and Outsider tokens that are upside-down, which means
    their alignment is the opposite of what is printed.
