  Each day, you may visit the Storyteller to learn 2 things in private:
  1 is true & 1 is false.
---

The Savant gets crazy, amazing information that is different every day
and every game, but exactly half of it is completely false.

- Each day, the Storyteller chooses two pieces of information to give
  the Savant... so get creative! One must be true, and one must be
  false, and the Savant won’t know which is which.
- It is up to the Savant to talk with the Storyteller, not the other way
  around. This isn’t a public conversation, and the group can’t listen
  in. It’s private.
- The Savant can choose to not visit the Storyteller if they wish.
- A drunk or poisoned Savant might get two pieces of true information or
  two pieces of false information.

## How To Run

Once per day, if the Savant requests a private chat with you, take them
away from the circle so you cannot be overheard. Whisper two pieces of
information, one true and one false, to the Savant. (_If you cannot
think of two straight away, either take your time or ask them to come
back in a few minutes._)
