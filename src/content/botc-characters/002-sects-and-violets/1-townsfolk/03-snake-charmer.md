The Snake Charmer learns player after player that is not the Demon...
but becomes the Demon if they get either too greedy or too bold.

- Each night, they choose a player. If that player is not the Demon,
  nothing happens. If they are the Demon, the Snake Charmer becomes that
  Demon and turns evil, and the Demon becomes good and poisoned
  permanently.
- If the Philosopher has the Snake Charmer ability and becomes the
  Demon, the Demon becomes a poisoned Philosopher.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Snake Charmer. They point at any player.

If that player is not the Demon, nothing happens. Put the Snake Charmer
to sleep.

If that player is the Demon, the old Snake Charmer changes into the new
(evil) Demon, and the old Demon changes into the new (good) Snake
Charmer—swap the Snake Charmer token and the Demon’s token. The new
Snake Charmer is **poisoned** - mark them with the **POISONED**
reminder. Wake the new Demon and show them the **YOU ARE** info token, a
thumbs-down, the **YOU ARE** token, then the Demon’s token. (This shows
they are now evil and the Demon.) Put the new Demon to sleep. Wake the
new Snake Charmer and show them the **YOU ARE** info token, a thumbs-up,
the **YOU ARE** info token, then the Snake Charmer token. (This shows
they are now good and the Snake Charmer.) Put the new Snake Charmer to
sleep.
