The Mathematician knows how many things have gone wrong since dawn
today.

- When an ability does not work in the intended way due to another
  character’s interference, the Mathematician will learn that it
  happened. They’ll learn that something went wrong if a piece of
  information was false but was supposed to be true, or if an ability
  should have worked but didn’t, due to another character.
- The Mathematician does not learn which players this happened to, only
  how many times it happened.
- The Mathematician does not detect their own ability failing.
- The Mathematician does not detect drunkenness or poisoning itself, but
  does detect when drunk or poisoned players’ abilities did not work as
  intended. The Recluse registering as evil to the Chef, and the
  poisoned Soldier dying from the Imp’s attack, would each be detected.
  The poisoned Empath getting true information would not.

## How To Run

Each time a character’s ability works abnormally due to another
character’s ability, mark them with an **ABNORMAL** reminder.

Each night, wake the Mathematician. Show fingers (0, 1, 2, etc.)
equaling the number of characters with **ABNORMAL** reminders. Put the
Mathematician to sleep. Remove all **ABNORMAL** reminders.
