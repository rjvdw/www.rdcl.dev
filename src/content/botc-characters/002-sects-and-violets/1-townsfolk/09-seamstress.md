The Seamstress learns whether 2 players are on the same team as each
other.

- They only get this information once per game, so they had best choose
  wisely when and who.
- They may choose alive or dead players or even Travellers.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Seamstress. They either shake their head no or
point at any two players except themself.

If they shake their head no, nothing happens. Put the Seamstress to
sleep.

If they point at two players, either nod your head yes (_to indicate
these players have the same alignment_) or shake your head no (_to
indicate these players do not have the same alignment_). Put the
Seamstress to sleep. The Seamstress loses their ability - mark them with
the **NO ABILITY** reminder and remove their night token from the night
sheet.
