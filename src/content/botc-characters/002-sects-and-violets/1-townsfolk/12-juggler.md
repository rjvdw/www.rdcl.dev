The Juggler takes the risk of convincing people to reveal their
characters on the 1st day, in the hope of guessing as many as possible
that are telling the truth.

- On the first day, they may guess which players are which characters.
  That night, the Juggler learns how many guesses they got right... if
  they are not killed beforehand.
- They must make their guesses publicly, so everyone hears what is
  guessed. They may guess zero characters, or up to five characters, and
  these characters and players may be different or the same.
- If the Juggler made their guesses while drunk or poisoned, but is
  sober and healthy when their ability triggers that night, then the
  Storyteller still gives them true information.

## How To Run

During the first day, if the Juggler declares that they are using their
ability, then you enter the circle, holding the Grimoire. The Juggler
can make up to five guesses, each of any one player and any one
character. For each correct guess, mark the Juggler with a **CORRECT**
reminder. (_Make sure the players don’t see how many reminders you’re
placing._)

That night, wake the Juggler. Show them fingers (0, 1, 2, etc.) equaling
the number of **CORRECT** reminders. Put the Juggler to sleep. Remove
the **CORRECT** reminders and the Juggler’s night token when convenient.
