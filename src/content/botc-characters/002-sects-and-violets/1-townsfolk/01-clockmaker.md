The Clockmaker knows the distance from the Demon to it's nearest Minion,
either clockwise or anti-clockwise.

- The Clockmaker only learns this on the first night.
- The distance is the number of seated players, starting from the player
  next to the Demon and ending at the nearest Minion, either clockwise
  or counterclockwise.

## How To Run

During the first night, wake the Clockmaker. Show fingers (1, 2 etc.)
equaling the distance in players from the Demon to the nearest Minion,
starting with the player neighboring the Demon closer to that Minion.
Put the Clockmaker to sleep.
