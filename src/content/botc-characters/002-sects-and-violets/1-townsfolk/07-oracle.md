The Oracle knows how many dead players are evil.

- Because the Oracle acts after the Demon attacks each night, the
  Oracleâ€™s info refers to the players that are dead when dawn breaks and
  all players open their eyes.
- The Oracle detects dead Minions and Demons, but also any other players
  that are evil, such as evil Travellers, or Townsfolk or Outsiders that
  have been turned evil.
- When counting the number of dead players, remember to count Townsfolk
  and Outsider tokens that are upside-down, which means their alignment
  is the opposite of what is printed.

## How To Run

Each night except the first, wake the Oracle. Show fingers (0, 1, 2,
etc.) equaling the number of dead evil players. Then, put the Oracle to
sleep.
