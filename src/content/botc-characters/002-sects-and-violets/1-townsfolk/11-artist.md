  Once per game, during the day, privately ask the Storyteller any
  yes/no question.
---

The Artist may ask any 1 question, and get an honest answer.

- The question may deal with anything at all, phrased in any way they
  want. The Storyteller honestly answers “yes,” “no,” or “I don’t know.”
- It is up to the Artist to talk with the Storyteller, not the other way
  around. This isn’t a public conversation, and the group can’t listen
  in. It’s private.

## How To Run

During any day, the Artist can request a private chat with you. Take
them away from the circle so you cannot be overheard. They will ask you
a question. Whisper “Yes,” “No,” or “I don’t know,” to them, or if you
cannot answer in one of these ways, prompt the Artist to ask again in a
different way. **The Artist loses their ability** - mark them with the
**NO ABILITY** reminder.
