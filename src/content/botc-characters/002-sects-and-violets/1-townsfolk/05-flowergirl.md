The Flowergirl knows if the Demon voted or not.

- A Demon’s vote counts whether or not the nominee was executed.
- The Flowergirl does not detect if the Demon raised their hand for
  other reasons, such as when the players “vote” on what to order for
  dinner, or when the players raise their hand to exile a Traveller.
- If the Demon changes players after the original Demon voted but before
  the Flowergirl wakes to learn their information, the Flowergirl
  detects the original Demon.
- If there are two (or more!) Demons, even dead Demons, the Flowergirl
  detects if any of them voted. If even one Demon voted, the Flowergirl
  learns a “yes”.

## How To Run

Each dawn, mark the Flowergirl with the **DEMON NOT VOTED** reminder,
and remove the **DEMON VOTED** reminder, if any.

Each day, if the Demon votes for any execution, replace the **DEMON NOT
VOTED** reminder with the **DEMON VOTED** reminder.

Each night except the first, wake the Flowergirl. If the Flowergirl is
marked **DEMON NOT VOTED**, shake your head no. If the Flowergirl is
marked **DEMON VOTED**, nod your head yes. Then, put the Flowergirl to
sleep.
