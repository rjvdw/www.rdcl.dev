  Each night, you learn how many players' abilities worked abnormally
  (since dawn) due to another character's ability.

  The Mathematician knows how many things have gone wrong since dawn
  today.

  - When an ability does not work in the intended way due to another
    character’s interference, the Mathematician will learn that it
    happened. They’ll learn that something went wrong if a piece of
    information was false but was supposed to be true, or if an ability
    should have worked but didn’t, due to another character.
  - The Mathematician does not learn which players this happened to,
    only how many times it happened.
  - The Mathematician does not detect their own ability failing.
  - The Mathematician does not detect drunkenness or poisoning itself,
    but does detect when drunk or poisoned players’ abilities did not
    work as intended. The Recluse registering as evil to the Chef, and
    the poisoned Soldier dying from the Imp’s attack, would each be
    detected. The poisoned Empath getting true information would not.

  Each time a character’s ability works abnormally due to another
  character’s ability, mark them with an **ABNORMAL** reminder.

  Each night, wake the Mathematician. Show fingers (0, 1, 2, etc.)
  equaling the number of characters with **ABNORMAL** reminders. Put the
  Mathematician to sleep. Remove all **ABNORMAL** reminders.
