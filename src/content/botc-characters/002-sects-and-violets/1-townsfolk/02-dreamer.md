The Dreamer learns player's characters, but is not sure if their
information is entirely correct.

- Each night, the Dreamer chooses a player and learns two characters—one
  that the player is, and one that the player isn’t.
- The false character token depends on the chosen player’s true
  character type. If the Dreamer chooses a player who is a Townsfolk or
  Outsider, the false character token is any Minion or Demon. If they
  choose a player who is a Minion or Demon, the false character token is
  a Townsfolk or Outsider.
- The Dreamer may not choose themself, and may not choose a Traveller.

## How To Run

Each night, wake the Dreamer. They point at any player. If the chosen
player’s character is a Townsfolk or Outsider, show their character
token and any Minion or Demon token to the Dreamer. If the chosen
player’s character is a Minion or Demon, show their character token and
any Townsfolk or Outsider token to the Dreamer. Then, put the Dreamer to
sleep.
