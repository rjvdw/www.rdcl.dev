The Town Crier knows when Minions nominate.

- Each night, the Town Crier learns either a “yes” or a “no”.
- They do not learn which players are Minions or how many Minions made
  nominations, just whether or not any Minions made nominations today.

## How To Run

Each dawn, mark the Town Crier with the **MINIONS NOT NOMINATED**
reminder, and remove the **MINION NOMINATED** reminder, if any.

Each day, if any Minion makes a nomination, replace the **MINIONS NOT
NOMINATED** reminder with the **MINION NOMINATED** reminder.

Each night except the first, wake the Town Crier. If the Town Crier is
marked **MINIONS NOT NOMINATED**, shake your head no. If the Town Crier
is marked **MINION NOMINATED**, nod your head yes. Then, put the Town
Crier to sleep. Remove the **MINION NOMINATED** reminder, if any.
