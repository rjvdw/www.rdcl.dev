      which is that Demon.

The Sage knows nothing while alive, but learns the most important
information of all at the moment of their death - who killed them.

- The Sage only gets this information when killed by a Demon attack.
  Being executed does not count.

## How To Run

If the Sage was killed by the Demon, wake the Sage. Point at two
players, one who is the Demon that killed the Sage. Put the Sage to
sleep.
