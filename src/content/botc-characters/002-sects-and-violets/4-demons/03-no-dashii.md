---

The No Dashii poisons their neighboring Townsfolk.

- The No Dashii’s closest clockwise and counterclockwise Townsfolk
  neighbors are poisoned, regardless of whether they are alive or dead.
  If a No Dashii dies or otherwise loses their ability, then those two
  players become healthy. Two Townsfolk players will always be poisoned
  this way, as neighboring Outsiders, Minions, or Travellers are
  skipped.
- If a new player becomes the No Dashii, or a poisoned Townsfolk changes
  into a non-Townsfolk character, the players who are poisoned may
  change immediately based on who the neighbors of the No Dashii are.

## How To Run

While preparing the first night, the two Townsfolk neighboring the No
Dashii become **poisoned** - mark them with **POISONED** reminders.

If a Townsfolk poisoned by the No Dashii becomes a non-Townsfolk
character, or the No Dashii turns into a different character, or if a
new player becomes the No Dashii, the new neighbors of the No Dashii
become **poisoned**, and the old neighbors become **healthy** - move the
No Dashii’s **POISONED** reminders immediately if needed.

Each night except the first, wake the No Dashii. They point at any
player. That player **dies** - mark them with the **DEAD** reminder. Put
the No Dashii to sleep.
