      they keep their ability and one of their Townsfolk neighbours is
      poisoned.

The Vigormortis kills their own Minions, but those Minions keep their
ability.

- Every time the Vigormortis kills a Minion, they die but keep their
  ability for as long as the Vigormortis remains alive. The Witch,
  Cerenovus, and Pit-Hag still act each night.
- Somewhat like the No Dashii, the dead Minion’s closest clockwise or
  closest counterclockwise Townsfolk becomes poisoned, even if they are
  dead. If the Vigormortis dies or otherwise loses their ability, then
  those players become healthy again. One Townsfolk per Minion will
  always be poisoned this way, as neighboring Outsiders, Minions, or
  Travellers are skipped. The Storyteller chooses which of the two
  Townsfolk is poisoned.
- All Minions killed by the Vigormortis keep their ability and poison a
  Townsfolk, not just the most recent.
- If a dead Minion becomes a non-Minion character, they no longer poison
  a Townsfolk and have no ability. If a dead Minion becomes drunk or
  poisoned, they lose their ability until they become sober and healthy
  again.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, before putting the character tokens in the
bag, remove one Outsider character token and add one Townsfolk character
token. (_If there are no Outsider tokens to remove, do not add a
Townsfolk token._)

Each night except the first, wake the Vigormortis. They point at any
player. Put the Vigormortis to sleep. If the chosen player isn’t a
Minion, that player **dies** - mark them with a **DEAD** reminder.

If the chosen player is a Minion, that player **dies** - mark them with
a **DEAD** reminder and a **HAS ABILITY** reminder. The closest
clockwise or closest counterclockwise Townsfolk to the Minion becomes
**poisoned** - mark them with a **POISONED** reminder.
