  Each night*, choose a player: they die. Townsfolk abilities yield
  false info. Each day, if no-one is executed, evil wins.
description: |
  The Vortox makes all information false.

  - Anytime a Townsfolk player gets information from their ability, they
    get false information. Even if they are drunk or poisoned, it must
    be false.
  - The Vortox does not affect information gained by other means, such
    as when the Storyteller explains the rules, or when a playerâ€™s
    character or alignment changes.
  - When night falls, if nobody was executed today, evil wins. Exiling a
    Traveller does not count.
howToRun: |
  While the Vortox is alive, you must give false information whenever a
  Townsfolk ability prompts you to give information.

  Each night except the first, wake the Vortox. They point at any
  player. That player **dies** - mark them with the **DEAD** reminder.
  Put the Vortox to sleep.

  Each dusk, if no player was executed today, the game ends and the evil
  team wins.
