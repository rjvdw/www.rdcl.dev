      The Fang Gu points to a player. That player dies. Or, if that
      player was an Outsider and there are no other Fang Gu in play: The
      Fang Gu dies instead of the chosen player. The chosen player is
      now an evil Fang Gu. Wake the new Fang Gu. Show the 'You are'
      card, then the Fang Gu token. Show the 'You are' card, then the
      thumb-down 'evil' hand sign.

The Fang Gu possesses Outsiders.

- The first time a Fang Gu attacks and kills an Outsider, the Fang Gu
  dies, and the Outsider becomes a Fang Gu and turns evil.
- This can only happen once per game. If the new Fang Gu attacks an
  Outsider, the Outsider dies as normal.
- The new Fang Gu counts as the Demon, and good wins if they die. They
  do not learn which players are Minions.
- There is an extra Outsider in play.
- If the Fang Gu attacks an Outsider but that Outsider does not die,
  that Outsider does not become an evil Fang Gu and the Fang Gu does not
  die.

## How To Run

While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag,
add one extra Outsider character token and remove one Townsfolk
character token.

Each night except the first, wake the Fang Gu. They point at any player.
Put the Fang Gu to sleep.

If the chosen player is not an Outsider, that player dies—mark them with
the **DEAD** reminder.

If the chosen player is an Outsider and the **ONCE** reminder is in the
center of the Grimoire, that player dies—mark them with the **DEAD**
reminder.

If the chosen player is an Outsider and the **ONCE** reminder is not in
the centre of the Grimoire, the Fang Gu dies—mark them with the **DEAD**
reminder. Wake the chosen Outsider. Show them the **YOU ARE** info
token, then the **Fang Gu** token, then the **YOU ARE** info token, then
a thumbs-down. Change their character to a Fang Gu—swap their character
token with the spare Fang Gu token. They become **evil**. Put the new
Fang Gu to sleep. Put the **ONCE** reminder in the center of the
Grimoire. (_Unlike “Once per game” abilities, this reminder stays there
for the rest of the game. Don’t remove it, even if the Fang Gu dies or
changes character._)
