  Each night*, choose a player: they die. Your 2 Townsfolk neighbors are
  poisoned.

  The No Dashii poisons their neighboring Townsfolk.

  - The No Dashii’s closest clockwise and counterclockwise Townsfolk
    neighbors are poisoned, regardless of whether they are alive or
    dead. If a No Dashii dies or otherwise loses their ability, then
    those two players become healthy. Two Townsfolk players will always
    be poisoned this way, as neighboring Outsiders, Minions, or
    Travellers are skipped.
  - If a new player becomes the No Dashii, or a poisoned Townsfolk
    changes into a non-Townsfolk character, the players who are poisoned
    may change immediately based on who the neighbors of the No Dashii
    are.

  While preparing the first night, the two Townsfolk neighboring the No
  Dashii become **poisoned** - mark them with **POISONED** reminders.

  If a Townsfolk poisoned by the No Dashii becomes a non-Townsfolk
  character, or the No Dashii turns into a different character, or if a
  new player becomes the No Dashii, the new neighbors of the No Dashii
  become **poisoned**, and the old neighbors become **healthy** - move
  the No Dashii’s **POISONED** reminders immediately if needed.

  Each night except the first, wake the No Dashii. They point at any
  player. That player **dies** - mark them with the **DEAD** reminder.
  Put the No Dashii to sleep.
