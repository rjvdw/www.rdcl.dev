The Vortox makes all information false.

- Anytime a Townsfolk player gets information from their ability, they
  get false information. Even if they are drunk or poisoned, it must be
  false.
- The Vortox does not affect information gained by other means, such as
  when the Storyteller explains the rules, or when a player’s character
  or alignment changes.
- When night falls, if nobody was executed today, evil wins. Exiling a
  Traveller does not count.

## How To Run

While the Vortox is alive, you must give false information whenever a
Townsfolk ability prompts you to give information.

Each night except the first, wake the Vortox. They point at any player.
That player **dies** - mark them with the **DEAD** reminder. Put the
Vortox to sleep.

Each dusk, if no player was executed today, the game ends and the evil
team wins.
