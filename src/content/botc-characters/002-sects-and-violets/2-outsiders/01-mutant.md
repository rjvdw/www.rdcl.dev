  If you are "mad" about being an Outsider, you might be executed.

The Mutant is killed if they try to reveal who they are.

- “Madness” is a term that means “you are trying to convince the group
  of something.” So, if the Mutant player is mad about being the Mutant,
  this means they are trying to convince people that they are the
  Mutant. If they are mad about being an Outsider, this means they are
  trying to convince people that they are an Outsider.
- This can be by verbally hinting who they are, or by their silence when
  questioned. It is always up to the Storyteller to decide what the
  Mutant is doing. If you think they are trying to convince the group
  they are an Outsider in any way, you can execute them—even outside the
  nomination phase, or at night. If you do, no other executions may
  happen today by normal means, since there is only one execution per
  day.
- If the Mutant hints that they are the Mutant at night, you may execute
  them that night, even if an execution happened today. Declare they
  have died, and continue the night phase as normal. An execution may
  still happen the next day.

## How To Run

At any time (_even at night_), if you believe that the Mutant is mad
about being an Outsider, then you can decide to execute the Mutant.
Declare this to the group. They die - mark them with a shroud.

If you execute them during the day before the normal execution happens,
go to the night phase. (_There is a maximum of one execution per day._)
