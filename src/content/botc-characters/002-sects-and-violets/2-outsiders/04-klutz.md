  When you learn that you died, publicly choose 1 alive player: if they
  are evil, your team loses.

The Klutz might accidentally lose the game for their team, unless they
are clever.

- When the Klutz dies, they must declare a player. They may take a few
  minutes to do so—after all, it’s a big decision, and other players may
  give advice on who to choose, but it is always the Klutz’s decision.
  If they choose an evil player, the game ends immediately and the good
  team loses. If they choose a good player, nothing happens and the game
  continues.
- It is not the Storyteller’s responsibility to prompt the Klutz to
  declare they are the Klutz and choose a player. The Klutz must do this
  shortly after they learn that they are dead. Deliberately not doing so
  is considered cheating.

## How To Run

When the Klutz player is declared dead, they must declare that they are
the Klutz and then point at any player. (_Give them time._) If they
choose an evil player, the game ends and the evil team wins. If they
choose a good player, the game continues.

In the strange situation where the Klutz is evil and chooses an evil
player, then the game ends and the good team wins instead.
