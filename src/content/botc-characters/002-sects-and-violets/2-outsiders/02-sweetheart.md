The Sweetheart, when they die, causes someone to be drunk for the rest
of the game.

- The Storyteller chooses which player becomes drunk.
- This ability works while the Sweetheart is dead.

## How To Run

If the Sweetheart dies, you choose any one player to become **drunk**

- mark this player with the **DRUNK** reminder. The Sweetheart does not
  lose this ability when dead.
