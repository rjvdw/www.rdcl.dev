  If you died today or tonight, the Demon may choose 2 players (not
  another Demon) to swap characters.
description: |
  The Barber allows the Demon to swap any 2 player's characters.

  - The players’ alignments stay the same when they swap characters.
    Each player learns which character they become.
  - The Demon may choose not to swap players.
  - If a player becomes a new character, they gain the new ability, even
    if it was a “you start knowing” ability or a “once per game” ability
    that the original character already used.
  - If there is more than one living Demon, the Storyteller chooses
    which Demon makes the swap.
  - The Demon may choose themself to swap.
  - The Demon may not choose another Demon player to swap.
  - If a player dies then becomes the Barber, the Demon may not swap two
    players’ characters tonight.
howToRun: |
  If the Barber dies, mark them with the **HAIRCUTS TONIGHT** reminder.

  During that night, wake the Demon. Show them the **THIS CHARACTER
  SELECTED YOU** info token, then the Barber token. The Demon either
  shakes their head no or points to two players. Put the Demon to sleep.
  Remove the **HAIRCUTS TONIGHT** reminder.

  If the Demon pointed to two players, swap the character tokens of the
  chosen players. One at a time, wake each swapped player, show them the
  **YOU ARE** info token and their new character token, then put them to
  sleep. If a player’s alignment does not match the color of their
  character token, turn it upside-down.

      If the Barber died today: Wake the Demon. Show the 'This character
      selected you' card, then Barber token. The Demon either shows a
      'no' head signal, or points to 2 players. If they chose players:
      Swap the character tokens. Wake each player. Show 'You are', then
      their new character token.
