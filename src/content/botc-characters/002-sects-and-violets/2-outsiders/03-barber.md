      If the Barber died today: Wake the Demon. Show the 'This character
      selected you' card, then Barber token. The Demon either shows a
      'no' head signal, or points to 2 players. If they chose players:
      Swap the character tokens. Wake each player. Show 'You are', then
      their new character token.

The Barber allows the Demon to swap any 2 player's characters.

- The players’ alignments stay the same when they swap characters. Each
  player learns which character they become.
- The Demon may choose not to swap players.
- If a player becomes a new character, they gain the new ability, even
  if it was a “you start knowing” ability or a “once per game” ability
  that the original character already used.
- If there is more than one living Demon, the Storyteller chooses which
  Demon makes the swap.
- The Demon may choose themself to swap.
- The Demon may not choose another Demon player to swap.
- If a player dies then becomes the Barber, the Demon may not swap two
  players’ characters tonight.

## How To Run

If the Barber dies, mark them with the **HAIRCUTS TONIGHT** reminder.

During that night, wake the Demon. Show them the **THIS CHARACTER
SELECTED YOU** info token, then the Barber token. The Demon either
shakes their head no or points to two players. Put the Demon to sleep.
Remove the **HAIRCUTS TONIGHT** reminder.

If the Demon pointed to two players, swap the character tokens of the
chosen players. One at a time, wake each swapped player, show them the
**YOU ARE** info token and their new character token, then put them to
sleep. If a player’s alignment does not match the color of their
character token, turn it upside-down.
