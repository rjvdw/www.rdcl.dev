tagLine: >-
  When you learn that you died, publicly choose 1 alive player: if they
  are evil, your team loses.
description: |
  The Klutz might accidentally lose the game for their team, unless they
  are clever.

  - When the Klutz dies, they must declare a player. They may take a few
    minutes to do so—after all, it’s a big decision, and other players
    may give advice on who to choose, but it is always the Klutz’s
    decision. If they choose an evil player, the game ends immediately
    and the good team loses. If they choose a good player, nothing
    happens and the game continues.
  - It is not the Storyteller’s responsibility to prompt the Klutz to
    declare they are the Klutz and choose a player. The Klutz must do
    this shortly after they learn that they are dead. Deliberately not
    doing so is considered cheating.

  When the Klutz player is declared dead, they must declare that they
  are the Klutz and then point at any player. (*Give them time.*) If
  they choose an evil player, the game ends and the evil team wins. If
  they choose a good player, the game continues.

  In the strange situation where the Klutz is evil and chooses an evil
  player, then the game ends and the good team wins instead.
